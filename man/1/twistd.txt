NAME
       twistd - run Twisted applications (TACs, TAPs)

SYNOPSIS
       twistd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  a	twisted.application.service.Application  out of a file and run
       it.

OPTIONS
       -n, --nodaemon Don't daemonize (stay in foreground).

       -q, --quiet
	      No-op for backwards compatibility.

       -p, --profile <profile output>
	      Run the application under the profiler, dumping results  to  the
	      specified file.

       --profiler <profiler name>
	      Specify the profiler to use. Defaults to the 'hotshot' profiler.

       --savestats
	      Save the Stats object rather than the text output  of  the  pro-
	      filer.

       -b, --debug
	      Run  the	application in the Python Debugger (implies --nodaemon
	      option).	Sending a SIGINT or SIGUSR2 signal to the process will
	      drop it into the debugger.

       -e, --encrypted <file>
	      The specified tap/aos file is encrypted.

       --euid Set only effective user-id rather than real user-id. This option
	      has no effect unless the server is running  as  root,  in  which
	      case  it	means  not to shed all privileges after binding ports,
	      retaining the option to  regain  privileges  in  cases  such  as
	      spawning processes. Use with caution.

       -o, --no_save
	      Do not save shutdown state.

       --originalname
	      Behave  as  though the specified Application has no process name
	      set, and run with the standard process name (the	Python	binary
	      in most cases).

       -l, --logfile <logfile>
	      Log  to  a  specified  file, - for stdout (default: twistd.log).
	      The log file will be rotated on SIGUSR1.

       -l, --logger <fully qualified python name>
	      A fully-qualified name to a log observer factory to use for  the
	      initial log observer. Takes precedence over --logfile and --sys-
	      log.

       --pidfile <pidfile>
	      Save pid in specified file (default: twistd.pid).

       --chroot <directory>
	      Chroot to a supplied directory before  running  (default:  don't
	      chroot).	 Chrooting  is done before changing the current direc-
	      tory.

       -d, --rundir <directory>
	      Change to a supplied directory before running (default: .).

       -u, --uid <uid>
	      The uid to run as (default: don't change).

       -g, --gid <gid>
	      The gid to run as (default: don't change).

       --umask <mask>
	      The (octal) file creation mask to apply. (default: 0077 for dae-
	      mons, no change otherwise).

       -r, --reactor <reactor>
	      Choose  which  reactor to use. See --help-reactors for a list of
	      possibilities.

       --help-reactors
	      List the names of possibly available reactors.

       --spew Write an extremely verbose log of everything that happens.  Use-
	      ful for debugging freezes or locks in complex code.

       -f, --file <tap file>
	      Read the given .tap file (default: twistd.tap).

       -s, --source <tas file>
	      Load  an	Application  from  the	given .tas (AOT Python source)
	      file.

       -y, --python <python file>
	      Use the variable "application" from the given Python file.  This
	      option overrides -f. This option implies --no_save.

       --syslog
	      Log to syslog instead of a file.

       --version
	      Print version information and exit.

       --prefix <prefix>
	      Use  the	specified  prefix  when logging to logfile. Default is
	      "twisted".

       Note that if twistd is run  as  root,  the  working  directory  is  not
       searched for Python modules.

SIGNALS
       A  running  twistd  accepts  SIGINT for a clean shutdown and SIGUSR1 to
       rotate log files.
