NAME
     sdef -- scripting definition extractor

SYNOPSIS
     sdef application

DESCRIPTION
     sdef gets the scripting definition (``sdef'') from the specified script-
     able application and writes it to standard output.  The application does
     not have to have an actual sdef in it; sdef can translate from the older
     aete and Cocoa suite definition (scriptSuite/scriptTerminology pairs)
     formats.

     From there, you can examine the sdef directly, or pipe it to sdp(1) for
     further processing.
