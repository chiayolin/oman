NAME
       uuname - list remote UUCP sites

SYNOPSIS
       uuname [-a] [--aliases]

       uuname [-l] [--local]

DESCRIPTION
       By default, the uuname program simply lists the names of all the remote
       systems mentioned in the UUCP configuration files.

       The uuname program may also be used to print the UUCP name of the local
       system.

       The uuname program is mainly for use by shell scripts.
