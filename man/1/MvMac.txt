NAME
     /usr/bin/MvMac -- move files while preserving metadata and forks (DEPRE-
     CATED)

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/MvMac source ... directory

DESCRIPTION
     Tools supporting Carbon development, including /usr/bin/MvMac, were dep-
     recated with Xcode 6.

     /usr/bin/MvMac moves each file named by a source operand to a destination
     file in the existing directory named by the directory operand.  The des-
     tination path for each operand is the pathname produced by the concatena-
     tion of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname component of
     the named file.

     If the destination path does not have a mode that permits writing,
     /usr/bin/MvMac will return an error.

NOTES
     The MvMac command does not support the same options as the POSIX mv com-
     mand, and is much less flexible in its operands.  It cannot be used as a
     direct substitute for mv in scripts.

     As of Mac OS X 10.4, the mv command preserves metadata and resource forks
     of files on Extended HFS volumes, so it can be used in place of MvMac.
     The MvMac command will be deprecated in future versions of Mac OS X.

BUGS
     Currently doesn't work across volumes/filesystems.
