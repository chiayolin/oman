NAME
       perror - explain error codes

SYNOPSIS
       perror [options] errorcode ...

DESCRIPTION
       For most system errors, MySQL displays, in addition to an internal text
       message, the system error code in one of the following styles:

	   message ... (errno: #)
	   message ... (Errcode: #)

       You can find out what the error code means by examining the
       documentation for your system or by using the perror utility.

       perror prints a description for a system error code or for a storage
       engine (table handler) error code.

       Invoke perror like this:

	   shell> perror [options] errorcode ...

       Example:

	   shell> perror 13 64
	   OS error code  13:  Permission denied
	   OS error code  64:  Machine is not on the network

       To obtain the error message for a MySQL Cluster error code, invoke
       perror with the --ndb option:

	   shell> perror --ndb errorcode

       The meaning of system error messages may be dependent on your operating
       system. A given error code may mean different things on different
       operating systems.

       perror supports the following options.

       o   --help, --info, -I, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --ndb

	   Print the error message for a MySQL Cluster error code.

       o   --silent, -s

	   Silent mode. Print only the error message.

       o   --verbose, -v

	   Verbose mode. Print error code and message. This is the default
	   behavior.

       o   --version, -V

	   Display version information and exit.
