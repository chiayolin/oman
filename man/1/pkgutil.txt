NAME
     pkgutil -- Query and manipulate Mac OS X Installer packages and receipts.

SYNOPSIS
     pkgutil [options] [commands]

DESCRIPTION
     pkgutil reads and manipulates Mac OS X Installer flat packages, and pro-
     vides access to the ``receipt'' database used by the Installer. Options
     are processed first, and affect the operation of all commands. Multiple
     commands are performed sequentially in the given order.

     The files and directories where receipts are stored are subject to
     change. Always use pkgutil to query or modify them.

OPTIONS
     --help, -h  A brief summary of commands and usage.

     --force, -f
		 Don't ask for confirmation before performing a potentially
		 destructive or ambiguous operation.

     --verbose, -v
		 Output in a "human-readable" format with extra headers, foot-
		 ers, indentation, and other contextual information.

     --volume path
		 Perform all operations on the specified volume or home direc-
		 tory.	The root volume '/' will be used if unspecified.

     --edit-pkg package-id
		 Specifies an existing receipt to be modified in-place by
		 --learn.

     --only-files
		 List only files (not directories) in --files listing.

     --only-dirs
		 List only directories (not files) in --files listing.

     --regexp	 Try to match package-id arguments as a regular expression if
		 an exact match isn't found. See egrep(1) and re_format(7) for
		 syntax.

RECEIPT DATABASE COMMANDS
     --packages, --pkgs
		 List all installed package IDs on the specified --volume.

     --pkgs-plist
		 List all installed package IDs on the specified --volume in
		 Mac OS X plist(5) format.

     --pkgs=REGEXP
		 List all installed package IDs matching REGEXP on the speci-
		 fied --volume.  The equal sign (=) is required or the search
		 string will be ignored and all package IDs will be returned.
		 Be mindful of escaping characters in both your shell and the
		 regular expression.  (Eg, 'pkgutil --pkgs=\\.D' searches for
		 package IDs matching the literal '.D' after escaping the
		 backslash from your shell and then the dot from the regex to
		 make it literal.) Regular expressions are more complex than
		 simple shell globbing. A dot (.) matches any character, while
		 '*' matches zero or more of the previous character. See
		 re_format(7) for a complete description of the syntax.

     --files package-id
		 List all of the files installed under the package-id.

     --export-plist package-id
		 Print all receipt information about the specified package-id
		 in the standard Mac OS X plist(5) format.

     --verify package-id
		 Run repair_packages(8) to verify the specified package-id.

     --repair package-id
		 Run repair_packages(8) to repair the specified package-id.

     --pkg-info package-id
		 Print extended information about the specified package-id.

     --pkg-info-plist package-id
		 Print extended information about the specified package-id in
		 Mac OS X plist(5) format.

     --forget package-id
		 Discard all receipt data about package-id, but do not touch
		 the installed files.  DO NOT use this command from an
		 installer package script to fix broken package design.

     --learn path
		 Update the ACLs of the given path in the receipt identified
		 by --edit-pkg.  This affects subsequent repair operations on
		 the package. This command cannot be used from package postin-
		 stall scripts, but if a postinstall script changes the ACLs
		 on the installed files, the receipt is automatically be
		 updated to reflect those changes.  This command will not
		 update the filesystem permissions in the receipt.

     --pkg-groups package-id
		 List all of the package groups this package-id is a member
		 of.

     --groups	 List all of the package groups on the specified --volume.

     --groups-plist
		 List all of the package groups on the specified --volume in
		 Mac OS X plist(5) format.

     --group-pkgs group-id
		 List all of the packages that are members of this group-id.

     --file-info path
		 Show the metadata known about path.

     --file-info-plist path
		 Show the metadata known about path in Mac OS X plist(5) for-
		 mat.

FILE COMMANDS
     --expand pkg-path dir-path
		 Expand the flat package at pkg-path into a new directory
		 specified by dir-path.

     --flatten dir-path pkg-path
		 Flatten the dir-path into a new flat package created at
		 pkg-path.  The directory to be flattened must have the proper
		 contents and layout for a flat package.  This is not intended
		 as a substitute for pkgbuild(1).

     --bom path  Extract any BOM files from the flat pkg at path into /tmp and
		 return the filename(s).  Suggested use is as an argument to
		 lsbom(8).  Eg, "lsbom `pkgutil --bom path`". Note that some
		 flat package archives may contain no BOM, one BOM, or several
		 BOMs.

     --payload-files path
		 List the files archived within the payload of the uninstalled
		 flat package(s) contained at path.  This should be equivilant
		 to "lsbom -s `pkgutil --bom path`". Note that flat package
		 archives may contain more than one package, and the destina-
		 tion location for the uninstalled package(s) is unknown to
		 this command.

     --check-signature pkg-path
		 Check the validity and trust of the signature on the package
		 at pkg-path.  In addition to the status of the signature, the
		 associated certificate chain will be shown.
