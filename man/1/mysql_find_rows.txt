MYSQL_FIND_ROWS 	     MySQL Database System	       MYSQL_FIND_ROWS



NAME
       mysql_find_rows - extract SQL statements from files

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_find_rows [options] [file_name ...]

DESCRIPTION
	   Note
	   This utility is deprecated in MySQL 5.6.17 and removed in MySQL 5.7

       mysql_find_rows reads files containing SQL statements and extracts
       statements that match a given regular expression or that contain USE
       db_name or SET statements. The utility expects statements to be
       terminated with semicolon (;) characters.

       Invoke mysql_find_rows like this:

	   shell> mysql_find_rows [options] [file_name ...]

       Each file_name argument should be the name of file containing SQL
       statements. If no file names are given, mysql_find_rows reads the
       standard input.

       Examples:

	   mysql_find_rows --regexp=problem_table --rows=20 < update.log
	   mysql_find_rows --regexp=problem_table  update-log.1 update-log.2

       mysql_find_rows supports the following options:

       o   --help, --Information

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --regexp=pattern

	   Display queries that match the pattern.

       o   --rows=N

	   Quit after displaying N queries.

       o   --skip-use-db

	   Do not include USE db_name statements in the output.

       o   --start_row=N

	   Start output from this row.
