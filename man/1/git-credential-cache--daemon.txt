NAME
       git-credential-cache--daemon - Temporarily store user credentials in
       memory

SYNOPSIS
       git credential-cache--daemon [--debug] <socket>


DESCRIPTION
	   Note
	   You probably don't want to invoke this command yourself; it is
	   started automatically when you use git-credential-cache(1).

       This command listens on the Unix domain socket specified by <socket>
       for git-credential-cache clients. Clients may store and retrieve
       credentials. Each credential is held for a timeout specified by the
       client; once no credentials are held, the daemon exits.

       If the --debug option is specified, the daemon does not close its
       stderr stream, and may output extra diagnostics to it even after it has
       begun listening for clients.
