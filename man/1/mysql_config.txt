NAME
       mysql_config - display options for compiling clients

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_config options

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_config provides you with useful information for compiling your
       MySQL client and connecting it to MySQL. It is a shell script, so it is
       available only on Unix and Unix-like systems.

       mysql_config supports the following options.

       o   --cflags

	   C Compiler flags to find include files and critical compiler flags
	   and defines used when compiling the libmysqlclient library. The
	   options returned are tied to the specific compiler that was used
	   when the library was created and might clash with the settings for
	   your own compiler. Use --include for more portable options that
	   contain only include paths.

       o   --cxxflags

	   Like --cflags, but for C++ compiler flags. This option was added in
	   MySQL 5.6.4.

       o   --include

	   Compiler options to find MySQL include files.

       o   --libmysqld-libs, --embedded

	   Libraries and options required to link with the MySQL embedded
	   server.

       o   --libs

	   Libraries and options required to link with the MySQL client
	   library.

       o   --libs_r

	   Libraries and options required to link with the thread-safe MySQL
	   client library. In MySQL 5.6, all client libraries are thread-safe,
	   so this option need not be used. The --libs option can be used in
	   all cases.

       o   --plugindir

	   The default plugin directory path name, defined when configuring
	   MySQL.

       o   --port

	   The default TCP/IP port number, defined when configuring MySQL.

       o   --socket

	   The default Unix socket file, defined when configuring MySQL.

       o   --variable=var_name

	   Display the value of the named configuration variable. Permitted
	   var_name values are pkgincludedir (the header file directory),
	   pkglibdir (the library directory), and plugindir (the plugin
	   directory).

       o   --version

	   Version number for the MySQL distribution.

       If you invoke mysql_config with no options, it displays a list of all
       options that it supports, and their values:

	   shell> mysql_config
	   Usage: /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config [options]
	   Options:
	     --cflags	      [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -mcpu=pentiumpro]
	     --cxxflags       [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -mcpu=pentiumpro]
	     --include	      [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql]
	     --libs	      [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient
			       -lpthread -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto -ldl]
	     --libs_r	      [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient_r
			       -lpthread -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto -ldl]
	     --plugindir      [/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin]
	     --socket	      [/tmp/mysql.sock]
	     --port	      [3306]
	     --version	      [5.6.11]
	     --libmysqld-libs [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqld
			       -lpthread -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto -ldl -lcrypt]
	     --variable=VAR   VAR is one of:
		     pkgincludedir [/usr/local/mysql/include]
		     pkglibdir	   [/usr/local/mysql/lib]
		     plugindir	   [/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin]

       You can use mysql_config within a command line using backticks to
       include the output that it produces for a particular option. For
       example, to compile and link a MySQL client program, use mysql_config
       as follows:

	   shell> gcc -c `mysql_config --cflags` progname.c
	   shell> gcc -o progname progname.o `mysql_config --libs`
