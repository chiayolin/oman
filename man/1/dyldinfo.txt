NAME
     dyldinfo -- Displays information used by dyld in an executable

SYNOPSIS
     dyldinfo [-arch arch-name] [-dylibs] [-rebase] [-bind] [-weak_bind]
	      [-lazy_bind] [-export] [-opcodes] [-function_starts] file(s)

DESCRIPTION
     Executables built for Mac OS X 10.6 and later have a new format for the
     information in the __LINKEDIT segment.  The dyldinfo tool will display
     that information.

     The options are as follows:

     -arch arch
	     Only display the specified architecture.  Other architectures in
	     a universal image are ignored.

     -dylibs
	     Display the table of dylibs on which this image depends.

     -rebase
	     Display the table of rebasing information.  Rebasing is what dyld
	     does when an image is not loaded at its preferred address.  Typi-
	     cally, this involves updating pointers in the __DATA segment
	     which point within the image.

     -bind   Display the table of binding information.	These are the symbolic
	     fix ups that dyld must do when an image is loaded.

     -weak_bind
	     Display the table of weak binding information.  Typically, only
	     C++ progams will have any weak binding.  These are symbols which
	     dyld must unique accross all images.

     -lazy_bind
	     Display the table of lazy binding information. These are symbols
	     which dyld delays binding until they are first used.  Lazy bind-
	     ing is automatically used for all function calls to functions in
	     some external dylib.

     -export
	     Display the table symbols which this image exports.

     -opcodes
	     Display the low level opcodes used to encode all rebase and bind-
	     ing information.

     -function_starts
	     Decodes the list of function start addresses.
