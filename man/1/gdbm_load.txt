DESCRIPTION
       Create  a  gdbm	database file DB_FILE from the dump file FILE.	If the
       FILE argument is not supplied, output the created database to the stan-
       dard error.

       If  the	input  file is in ASCII dump format, the mode and ownership of
       the created database are restored from the  information	in  the  dump.
       This can be overridden using the command line options (see below).
