NAME
     mkdep -- construct Makefile dependency list

SYNOPSIS
     mkdep [-ap] [-f file] [flags] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     mkdep takes a set of flags for the C compiler and a list of C source
     files as arguments and constructs a set of include file dependencies
     which are written into the file ``.depend''.  An example of its use in a
     Makefile might be:

	   CFLAGS= -O -I../include
	   SRCS= file1.c file2.c

	   depend:
		   mkdep ${CFLAGS} ${SRCS}

     where the macro SRCS is the list of C source files and the macro CFLAGS
     is the list of flags for the C compiler.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Append to the output file, so that multiple mkdep's may be run
	     from a single Makefile.

     -f      Write the include file dependencies to file, instead of the
	     default ``.depend''.

     -p      Cause mkdep to produce dependencies of the form:

		   program: program.c

	     so that subsequent makes will produce program directly from its C
	     module rather than using an intermediate .o module.  This is use-
	     ful for programs whose source is contained in a single module.
