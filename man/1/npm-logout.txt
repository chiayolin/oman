NAME
       npm-logout - Log out of the registry

SYNOPSIS
	 npm logout [--registry=url] [--scope=@orgname]

DESCRIPTION
       When  logged  into a registry that supports token-based authentication,
       tell the server to end this token's session. This will  invalidate  the
       token everywhere you're using it, not just for the current environment.

       When logged into a legacy registry  that  uses  username  and  password
       authentication, this will clear the credentials in your user configura-
       tion. In this case, it will only affect the current environment.

       If --scope is provided, this will find the credentials for the registry
       connected to that scope, if set.

CONFIGURATION
   registry
       Default: http://registry.npmjs.org/

       The  base  URL of the npm package registry. If scope is also specified,
       it takes precedence.

   scope
       Default: none

       If specified, the user and login credentials given will	be  associated
       with the specified scope. See npm help 7 npm-scope. You can use both at
       the same time, e.g.

	 npm adduser --registry=http://myregistry.example.com --scope=@myco

       This will set a registry for the given scope and login or create a user
       for that registry at the same time.
