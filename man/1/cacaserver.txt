NAME
       cacaserver - telnet server for libcaca

SYNOPSIS
       cacaserver

DESCRIPTION
       cacaserver  reads  libcaca  animation  files  in its standard input and
       serves them as ANSI art on network port 51914. These animations can  be
       created	by  any libcaca program by setting the CACA_DRIVER environment
       variable to raw and piping the program's standard output to cacaserver.

       Clients	can  then  connect to port 51914 using telnet or netcat to see
       the output.

EXAMPLE
       CACA_DRIVER=raw cacademo | cacaserver

       telnet localhost 51914
