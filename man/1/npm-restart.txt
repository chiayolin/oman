NAME
       npm-restart - Restart a package

SYNOPSIS
	 npm restart [-- <args>]

DESCRIPTION
       This restarts a package.

       This runs a package's "stop", "restart", and "start" scripts, and asso-
       ciated pre- and post- scripts, in the order given below:

       1. prerestart

       2. prestop

       3. stop

       4. poststop

       5. restart

       6. prestart

       7. start

       8. poststart

       9. postrestart


NOTE
       Note that the "restart" script is run in addition  to  the  "stop"  and
       "start" scripts, not instead of them.

       This  is  the  behavior	as  of	npm major version 2.  A change in this
       behavior will be accompanied by an increase in major version number
