NAME
       npm-bundle - REMOVED

DESCRIPTION
       The  npm  bundle command has been removed in 1.0, for the simple reason
       that it is no longer necessary, as  the	default  behavior  is  now  to
       install packages into the local space.

       Just use npm install now to do what npm bundle used to do.

SEE ALSO
       o npm help install
