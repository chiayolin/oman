NAME
       npm-unpublish - Remove a package from the registry

SYNOPSIS
	 npm unpublish [@<scope>/]<name>[@<version>]

WARNING
       It is generally considered bad behavior to remove versions of a library
       that others are depending on!

       Consider using the deprecate command instead,  if  your	intent	is  to
       encourage users to upgrade.

       There is plenty of room on the registry.

DESCRIPTION
       This  removes  a  package version from the registry, deleting its entry
       and removing the tarball.

       If no version is specified, or if all versions  are  removed  then  the
       root package entry is removed from the registry entirely.

       Even  if  a package version is unpublished, that specific name and ver-
       sion combination can never be reused.  In order to publish the  package
       again, a new version number must be used.

       The  scope  is  optional  and  follows  the  usual rules for npm help 7
       npm-scope.
