NAME
     desdp -- scripting definition generator

SYNOPSIS
     desdp application

DESCRIPTION
     desdp generates a scripting definition (``sdef'') from the specified
     scriptable application and writes it to standard output.  The original
     dictionary may be either an aete resource or a set of Cocoa suite defini-
     tion files (scriptSuite/scriptTerminology pairs).

     desdp is primarily useful for developers with an existing scriptable
     application who want a shortcut to creating an sdef(5) file.  While the
     resulting sdef will contain all the information in the original dictio-
     nary, it will probably not be perfect, since sdef(5) is more expressive
     than either of the older aete or suite definition formats.  For instance,
     aete cannot specify which commands an object responds to, and suite defi-
     nitions cannot specify the ordering of terms.

SEE ALSO
     sdef(5), sdp(1)

BUGS
     desdp does not yet correctly support Cocoa ``Synonym'' sections or syn-
     onymous terms or codes in aete.
