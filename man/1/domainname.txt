NAME
     domainname -- set or print name of current YP/NIS domain

SYNOPSIS
     domainname [ypdomain]

DESCRIPTION
     The domainname utility prints the name of the current YP/NIS domain.  The
     super-user can set the domain name by supplying an argument; this is usu-
     ally done at startup by specifying a domain name in the contents of the
     file /etc/defaultdomain.

NOTES
     The YP/NIS (formerly ``Yellow Pages'' but renamed for legal reasons)
     domain name does not necessarily have anything to do with the Domain Name
     System domain name, although they are often set equal for administrative
     convenience.

SEE ALSO
     getdomainname(3)

HISTORY
     The domainname command appeared in FreeBSD 1.1, based on a similar com-
     mand in SunOS.
