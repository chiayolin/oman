NAME
       lpr - print files

SYNOPSIS
       lpr  [  -E  ]  [  -H  server[:port]  ]  [  -U  username ] [ -P destina-
       tion[/instance] ] [ -#  num-copies  [  -h  ]  [	-l  ]  [  -m  ]  [  -o
       option[=value]  ]  [  -p ] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -C title ] [ -J title ] [ -T
       title ] [ file(s) ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpr submits files for printing.	Files named on the  command  line  are
       sent  to the named printer or the default destination if no destination
       is specified.  If no files are listed on the  command-line,  lpr  reads
       the print file from the standard input.

   THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS  provides many ways to set the default destination. The LPDEST and
       PRINTER environment variables are consulted first.  If neither are set,
       the  current  default  set using the lpoptions(1) command is used, fol-
       lowed by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by lpr:

       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -H server[:port]
	    Specifies an alternate server.

       -C "name"

       -J "name"

       -T "name"
	    Sets the job name/title.

       -P destination[/instance]
	    Prints files to the named printer.

       -U username
	    Specifies an alternate username.

       -# copies
	    Sets the number of copies to print.

       -h   Disables  banner  printing.  This  option  is  equivalent  to   -o
	    job-sheets=none.

       -l   Specifies  that the print file is already formatted for the desti-
	    nation and should be  sent	without  filtering.   This  option  is
	    equivalent to -o raw.

       -m   Send an email on job completion.

       -o option[=value]
	    Sets a job option.

       -p   Specifies  that  the  print file should be formatted with a shaded
	    header with the date, time,  job  name,  and  page	number.   This
	    option  is	equivalent  to	-o prettyprint and is only useful when
	    printing text files.

       -q   Hold job for printing.

       -r   Specifies that the named print files should be deleted after  sub-
	    mitting them.

NOTES
       The -c, -d, -f, -g, -i, -n, -t, -v, and -w options are not supported by
       CUPS and produce a warning message if used.

EXAMPLES
       Print two copies of a document to the default printer:

	   lpr -# 2 filename

       Print a double-sided legal document to a printer called "foo":

	   lpr -P foo -o media=legal -o sides=two-sided-long-edge filename

       Print a presentation document 2-up to a printer called "foo":

	   lpr -P foo -o number-up=2 filename
