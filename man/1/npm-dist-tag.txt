NAME
       npm-dist-tag - Modify package distribution tags

SYNOPSIS
	 npm dist-tag add <pkg>@<version> [<tag>]
	 npm dist-tag rm <pkg> <tag>
	 npm dist-tag ls [<pkg>]

DESCRIPTION
       Add, remove, and enumerate distribution tags on a package:

       o add:  Tags  the  specified  version of the package with the specified
	 tag, or the --tag config if not specified.

       o rm: Clear a tag that is no longer in use from the package.

       o ls: Show all of the dist-tags for a package, defaulting to the  pack-
	 age in the current prefix.


       A  tag can be used when installing packages as a reference to a version
       instead of using a specific version number:

	 npm install <name>@<tag>

       When installing dependencies, a preferred tagged version may be	speci-
       fied:

	 npm install --tag <tag>

       This also applies to npm dedupe.

       Publishing  a  package  sets  the "latest" tag to the published version
       unless the --tag option is used. For example, npm publish --tag=beta.

PURPOSE
       Tags can be used to provide an alias instead of version	numbers.   For
       example,  npm  currently  uses  the tag "next" to identify the upcoming
       version, and the tag "latest" to identify the current version.

       A project might choose to have multiple streams of  development,  e.g.,
       "stable", "canary".

CAVEATS
       This  command used to be known as npm tag, which only created new tags,
       and so had a different syntax.

       Tags must share a namespace with  version  numbers,  because  they  are
       specified  in the same slot: npm install <pkg>@<version> vs npm install
       <pkg>@<tag>.

       Tags that can be interpreted as valid semver ranges will  be  rejected.
       For example, v1.4 cannot be used as a tag, because it is interpreted by
       semver as >=1.4.0 <1.5.0.  See  https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6082.

       The simplest way to avoid semver problems with tags is to use tags that
       do not begin with a number or the letter v.
