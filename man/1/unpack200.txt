NAME
       unpack200 - JAR Unpacking tool

SYNOPSIS
       unpack200 [ OPTIONS ] input-file JAR-file

PARAMETERS
       The  options  may  be in any order. The last option on the command line
       supersedes all previously specified options.  For a discussion  of  the
       options, see OPTIONS below.

       input-file
	      name  of	the  input file, which can be a pack200 gzip file or a
	      pack200 file. The input could  also  be  JAR  file  produced  by
	      pack200(1)  with	an  effort of 0. In this case, the contents of
	      the input file will be copied to the output JAR file,  with  the
	      Pack200 marker.

       JAR-file
	      name of the output JAR file.

DESCRIPTION
       The  unpack200 tool is a native implementation that transforms a packed
       file produced by pack200(1) into a JAR file.

       Typical usage:

	      % unpack200 myarchive.pack.gz myarchive.jar

       In this example, the myarchive.jar is produced  from  myarchive.pack.gz
       using the default unpack200 settings.

OPTIONS
       -Hvalue --deflate-hint=value
	      Sets  the  deflation  to	be true, false, or keep on all entries
	      within a JAR file.  The default mode is keep. If true or	false,
	      overrides  the  default  behavior and sets the deflation mode on
	      all entries within the output JAR file.

Non-Standard Options
       -r --remove-pack-file
	      Removes the input packed-file.

       -v --verbose
	      Outputs minimal messages, multiple specification of this	option
	      will output more verbose messages.

       -q --quiet
	      Specifies quiet operation with no messages.

       -lfilename --log-file=filename
	      Specifies a log file to output messages.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

       0  Successful completion.

       >0  An error occurred.
