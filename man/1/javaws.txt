NAME
       javaws - Java Web Start launcher command

SYNOPSIS
       javaws [ options ] [ URL ]

PARAMETERS
       options	      Command-line options.  Options many be in any order. For
		      a discussion of the various options, see OPTIONS	below.

       URL	      Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the JNLP (Java Network
		      Launching Protocol) file.

DESCRIPTION
       The javaws command launches Java Web  Start,  which  is	the  reference
       implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP).  Java Web
       Start launches java application/applets hosted on a network.

       Without any options javaws will launch the Java JNLP  Application  Man-
       ager, from which users can launch applications/applet or configure Java
       Web Start.

       If a URL for a JNLP file is specified,  javaws  will  launch  the  Java
       application/applet specified in the JNLP file.

OPTIONS
       The javaws launcher has a set of options that are supported in the cur-
       rent release.  However, the options may be removed in a future release.
