NAME
       npm-explore - Browse an installed package

SYNOPSIS
	 npm explore <name> [ -- <cmd>]

DESCRIPTION
       Spawn a subshell in the directory of the installed package specified.

       If  a  command is specified, then it is run in the subshell, which then
       immediately terminates.

       This is particularly handy  in  the  case  of  git  submodules  in  the
       node_modules folder:

	 npm explore some-dependency -- git pull origin master

       Note  that  the	package is not automatically rebuilt afterwards, so be
       sure to use npm rebuild <pkg> if you make any changes.

CONFIGURATION
   shell
       o Default: SHELL environment variable, or "bash" on Posix, or "cmd"  on
	 Windows

       o Type: path


       The shell to run for the npm explore command.

       o npm help 5 folders

       o npm help edit
