NAME
     env -- set and print environment

SYNOPSIS
     env [-i] [name=value ...] [utility [argument ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     env executes utility after modifying the environment as specified on the
     command line.  The option name=value specifies an environmental variable,
     name, with a value of value.  The option `-i' causes env to completely
     ignore the environment it inherits.

     If no utility is specified, env prints out the names and values of the
     variables in the environment, with one name=value pair per line.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the utility is invoked, the exit status of env shall be the exit sta-
     tus of utility; otherwise, the env utility exits with one of the follow-
     ing values:

     0	     The env utility completed successfully

     1-125   An error occurred in the env utility.

     126     The utility specified by utility was found, but could not be
	     invoked.

     127     The utility specified by utility could not be found.

COMPATIBILITY
     The historic - option has been deprecated but is still supported in this
     implementation.

STANDARDS
     The env utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (``POSIX.2'').

BUGS
     env doesn't handle commands with equal (``='') signs in their names, for
     obvious reasons.
