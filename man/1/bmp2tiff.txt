NAME
       bmp2tiff  - create a TIFF file from a Microsoft Windows Device Indepen-
       dent Bitmap image file

SYNOPSIS
       bmp2tiff [ options ] input.bmp [ input2.bmp ... ] output.tiff

DESCRIPTION
       bmp2tiff converts a Microsoft Windows Device Independent  Bitmap  image
       file  to TIFF.  If several input BMP files are being specified the mul-
       tipage TIFF output file will be created. By default, the TIFF image  is
       created	with  data  samples packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), compressed
       with the PackBits algorithm (Compression=32773), and with each strip no
       more  than  8  kilobytes.   These  characteristics  can	overridden, or
       explicitly specified with the options described below.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify a compression scheme to use when writing image data:  -c
	      none  for  no compression, -c packbits for the PackBits compres-
	      sion algorithm (the default), -c jpeg for the baseline JPEG com-
	      pression	algorithm,  -c	zip  for the Deflate compression algo-
	      rithm, and -c lzw for Lempel-Ziv & Welch.

       -r number
	      Write data with a specified number of rows per strip; by default
	      the  number  of  rows/strip  is  selected  so that each strip is
	      approximately 8 kilobytes.
