DESCRIPTION
       ldapdelete  is  a  shell-accessible interface to the ldap_delete_ext(3)
       library call.

       ldapdelete opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and deletes one
       or  more  entries.   If	one or more DN arguments are provided, entries
       with those Distinguished Names are deleted.  Each DN should be provided
       using  the  LDAPv3 string representation as defined in RFC 4514.  If no
       DN arguments are provided, a list of DNs is read  from  standard  input
       (or from file if the -f flag is used).

OPTIONS
       -n     Show  what  would  be  done,  but don't actually delete entries.
	      Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -v     Use verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard out-
	      put.

       -c     Continuous   operation   mode.	Errors	 are   reported,   but
	      ldapdelete will  continue  with  deletions.   The default is  to
	      exit after reporting an error.

       -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.

       -d debuglevel
	      Set  the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapdelete must be
	      compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this  option  to  have  any
	      effect.

       -f file
	      Read a series of DNs from file, one per line, performing an LDAP
	      delete for each.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D binddn
	      Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
	      For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of spec-
	      ifying the password on the command line.

       -w passwd
	      Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y passwdfile
	      Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password  for	simple
	      authentication.

       -H ldapuri
	      Specify  URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the proto-
	      col/host/port fields are allowed; a list of  URI,  separated  by
	      whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h ldaphost
	      Specify  an  alternate host on which the ldap server is running.
	      Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p ldapport
	      Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server  is  listen-
	      ing.  Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -P {2|3}
	      Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

	      Specify  general	extensions  with -e and search extensions with
	      -E.  '!' indicates criticality.

	      General extensions:
		[!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
		[!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
		[!]manageDSAit
		[!]noop
		ppolicy
		[!]postread[=<attrs>]	     (a comma-separated attribute list)
		[!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
		abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

	      Search extensions:
		[!]domainScope				     (domain scope)
		[!]mv=<filter>				     (matched values filter)
		[!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]	     (paged results/prompt)
		[!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
		[!]subentries[=true|false]	     (subentries)
		[!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]			     (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
			rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -r     Do a recursive delete.  If the DN specified isn't  a  leaf,  its
	      children,  and all their children are deleted down the tree.  No
	      verification is done, so if you add this switch, ldapdelete will
	      happily delete large portions of your tree.  Use with care.

       -z sizelimit
	      Use  sizelimit when searching for children DN to delete, to cir-
	      cumvent any server-side size limit.  Only useful in  conjunction
	      with -r.

       -O security-properties
	      Specify SASL security properties.

       -I     Enable  SASL  Interactive  mode.	 Always prompt.  Default is to
	      prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U authcid
	      Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind.  The  form  of  the
	      identity depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R realm
	      Specify  the  realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form
	      of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X authzid
	      Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL  bind.   authzid
	      must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
	      u:<username>

       -Y mech
	      Specify the SASL mechanism to be	used  for  authentication.  If
	      it's  not  specified, the program will choose the best mechanism
	      the server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
	      you  use	-ZZ, the command will require the operation to be suc-
	      cessful.

EXAMPLE
       The following command:

	   ldapdelete "cn=Delete Me,dc=example,dc=com"

       will  attempt  to  delete  the  entry  named   "cn=Delete   Me,dc=exam-
       ple,dc=com".   Of  course  it  would  probably  be  necessary to supply
       authentication credentials.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero  exit
       status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
