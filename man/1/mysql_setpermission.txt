NAME
       mysql_setpermission - interactively set permissions in grant tables

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_setpermission [options]

DESCRIPTION
	   Note
	   This utility is deprecated in MySQL 5.6.17 and removed in MySQL 5.7

       mysql_setpermission is a Perl script that was originally written and
       contributed by Luuk de Boer. It interactively sets permissions in the
       MySQL grant tables.  mysql_setpermission is written in Perl and
       requires that the DBI and DBD::mysql Perl modules be installed (see
       Section 2.13, "Perl Installation Notes").

       Invoke mysql_setpermission like this:

	   shell> mysql_setpermission [options]

       options should be either --help to display the help message, or options
       that indicate how to connect to the MySQL server. The account used when
       you connect determines which permissions you have when attempting to
       modify existing permissions in the grant tables.

       mysql_setpermissions also reads options from the [client] and [perl]
       groups in the .my.cnf file in your home directory, if the file exists.

       mysql_setpermission supports the following options:

       o   --help

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --host=host_name

	   Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o   --password=password

	   The password to use when connecting to the server. Note that the
	   password value is not optional for this option, unlike for other
	   MySQL programs.

	   Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
	   insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
	   Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
	   on the command line.

       o   --port=port_num

	   The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o   --socket=path

	   For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use.

       o   --user=user_name

	   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.
