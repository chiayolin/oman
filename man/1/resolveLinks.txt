NAME
     resolveLinks -- Resolves link requests in collections of HTML files

SYNOPSIS
     resolveLinks [-a] [-b basepath] [-d debugflags] [-D] [-h]
		  [-i installpath] [-n] [-N] [-P] [-r refanchorprefix]
		  [-s seedfile] [-S seedfilebasepath] [-t nthreads]
		  [-x xreffile] directory

OPTIONS
     The available options are as follows:

     -a 	 Treat external (seeded) paths as absolute.  If passed after a
		 -s argument, modifies that argument.  If passed before any -s
		 arguments, modifies all seed files.  This may be specified
		 multiple times.

     -b 	 Base path. Paths in -x output file are generated relative to
		 this path.  If this ends with a trailing /, resolveLinks
		 assumes that the contents of the specified directory will be
		 installed in the location specified by the -i flag.  Other-
		 wise, it is assumed that the directory itself will be
		 installed there.  (The cp command behaves similarly.)	If
		 unspecified, defaults to /.

     -d 	 Sets debug flags (bitmask).

     -D 	 Disables dot printing (for cleaner debugging).

     -h 	 Prints a usage summary.

     -i 	 Location where this directory will eventually be installed.
		 Used for generating relative paths for external (seeded)
		 paths.  If unspecified, the value of the -b flag is used.

     -n 	 Disables all file writes (except for the seed output file).

     -N 	 Disables name-based matching (normally used for unknown sym-
		 bol names in user-entered link requests).  Disabling this
		 matching can provide a performance gain for large doc trees.

     -P 	 Disables partial matching.  Disabling this matching can pro-
		 vide a performance gain for large doc trees.

     -r 	 Additional reference anchor prefix.  The default,
		 "apple_ref", is always active; if you use something else, add
		 a -r option.  This may be specified multiple times.

     -s 	 A seed file generated by the -x option from a previous run of
		 the tool.  Used to add additional external cross references
		 from other folders.  This may be passed multiple times.

     -S 	 A base path prepended to the immediate previous seed file for
		 path purposes.  This may be passed multiple times (once per
		 seed file).

     -t 	 The number of threads to use during resolution.  Default is
		 2.

     -x 	 An output cross-reference file.  You can pass this file to
		 future runs of the tool by using the -s flag.

     directory	 the directory to be processed.

ENVIRONMENT
     This program is a helper tool that is usually run by the gatherHeaderDoc
     tool to generate links within HeaderDoc output.  Although it is usually
     not run directly, it can be useful to do so when linking together multi-
     ple documentation sets in an installed set.
