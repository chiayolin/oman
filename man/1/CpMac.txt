NAME
     /usr/bin/CpMac -- copy files preserving metadata and forks (DEPRECATED)

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/CpMac [-rp] [-mac] source target
     /usr/bin/CpMac [-rp] [-mac] source ... directory

DESCRIPTION
     Tools supporting Carbon development, including /usr/bin/CpMac, were dep-
     recated with Xcode 6.

     In its first form, the /usr/bin/CpMac utility copies the contents of the
     file named by the source operand to the destination path named by the
     target operand.  This form is assumed when the last operand does not name
     an already existing directory.

     In its second form, /usr/bin/CpMac copies each file named by a source op-
     erand to a destination directory named by the directory operand.  The
     destination path for each operand is the pathname produced by the con-
     catenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname component
     of the named file.

     The following options are available:

     -r    If source designates a directory, /usr/bin/CpMac copies the direc-
	   tory and the entire subtree connected at that point.  This option
	   also causes symbolic links to be copied, rather than indirected
	   through, and for /usr/bin/CpMac to create special files rather than
	   copying them as normal files.  Created directories have the same
	   mode as the corresponding source directory, unmodified by the
	   process' umask.

     -p    Causes /usr/bin/CpMac to preserve in the copy as many of the modi-
	   fication time, access time, file flags, file mode, user ID, and
	   group ID as allowed by permissions.

     -mac  Allows use of HFS-style paths for both source and target.  Path
	   elements must be separated by colons, and the path must begin with
	   a volume name or a colon (to designate current directory).

NOTES
     The /usr/bin/CpMac command does not support the same options as the POSIX
     cp command, and is much less flexible in its operands.  It cannot be used
     as a direct substitute for cp in scripts.

     As of Mac OS X 10.4, the cp command preserves metadata and resource forks
     of files on Extended HFS volumes, so it can be used in place of CpMac.
     The /usr/bin/CpMac command will be deprecated in future versions of Mac
     OS X.
