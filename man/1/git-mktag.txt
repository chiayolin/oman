NAME
       git-mktag - Creates a tag object

SYNOPSIS
       git mktag < signature_file


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a tag contents on standard input and creates a tag object that
       can also be used to sign other objects.

       The output is the new tag's <object> identifier.

TAG FORMAT
       A tag signature file has a very simple fixed format: four lines of

	   object <sha1>
	   type <typename>
	   tag <tagname>
	   tagger <tagger>

       followed by some optional free-form message (some tags created by older
       Git may not have tagger line). The message, when exists, is separated
       by a blank line from the header. The message part may contain a
       signature that Git itself doesn't care about, but that can be verified
       with gpg.
