NAME
       apt - annotation processing tool

SYNOPSIS
       apt  [ -classpath classpath ] [ -sourcepath sourcepath ] [ -d directory
       ] [ -s directory ] [ -factorypath path ] [ -factory class ] [ -print  ]
       [  -nocompile  ] [ -A [ key [ =val ] ] ] [ javac option ] sourcefiles [
       @files ]

DESCRIPTION
       The tool apt, annotation processing tool, includes a set of new reflec-
       tive APIs and supporting infrastructure to process program annotations.
       The apt reflective APIs provide a build-time,  source-based,  read-only
       view  of  program  structure.  These  reflective  APIs  are designed to
       cleanly model the JavaTM programming language's type system  after  the
       addition  of  generics.	First, apt runs annotation processors that can
       produce new source code and other files. Next, apt can  cause  compila-
       tion  of  both original and generated source files, easing development.
       The reflective APIs and other APIs used to interact with the  tool  are
       subpackages of com.sun.mirror.

       A  fuller  discussion  of how the tool operates as well as instructions
       for  developing	with  apt  are	in  Getting  Started   with   apt   at
       http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/GettingStarted.html.

PARAMETERS
       Options may be in any order. For a discussion of parameters which apply
       to a specific option, see OPTIONS below.

       sourcefiles    Zero or more source files to be processed.

       @files	      One or more  files  that	list  source  files  or  other
		      options.

OPTIONS
   apt specific options
       -s dir	      Specify  the directory root under which processor-gener-
		      ated source files will be placed; files  are  placed  in
		      subdirectories based on package namespace.

       -nocompile     Do not compile sources files to class files.

       -print	      Print  out  textual  representation  of specified types;
		      perform no annotation processing or compilation.

       -A[key[=val]]  Options to pass to annotation processors	--  these  are
		      not  interpreted by apt directly, but are made available
		      for use by individual processors

       -factorypath path
		      Specify where to find annotation processor factories; if
		      this  option  is used, the classpath is not searched for
		      factories.

       -factory classname
		      Name of annotation processor factory  to	use;  bypasses
		      default discovery process

   Options shared with javac
       -d dir	      Specify  where  to  place  processor and javac generated
		      class files

       -cp path       or
       -classpath path
		      Specify where to find user class	files  and  annotation
		      processor  factories.  If  -factorypath  is  given,  the
		      classpath is not searched for factories.

       Consult the javac(1) man page for information on javac options.

NOTES
       The apt tool and its associated APIs may be changed  or	superseded  in
       future j2se releases.
