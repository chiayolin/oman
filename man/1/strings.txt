NAME
       strings - find the printable strings in a object, or other binary, file

SYNOPSIS
       strings [ - ] [ -a ] [ -o ] [ -t format ] [ -number ]  [  -n  number  ]
       [--] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Strings	looks  for  ASCII  strings in a binary file or standard input.
       Strings is useful for identifying random object files  and  many  other
       things.	 A  string is any sequence of 4 (the default) or more printing
       characters ending with a newline or a  null.   Unless  the  -  flag  is
       given,  strings	looks  in  all sections of the object files except the
       (__TEXT,__text) section.  If no files are specified standard  input  is
       read.

       The  file arguments may be of the form libx.a(foo.o), to request infor-
       mation about only that object file and not the entire library.	(Typi-
       cally  this  argument must be quoted, ``libx.a(foo.o)'', to get it past
       the shell.)

       The options to strings(1) are:

       -a     This option causes strings to look for strings in  all  sections
	      of the object file (including the (__TEXT,__text) section.

       -      This  option  causes strings to look for strings in all bytes of
	      the files (the default for non-object files).

       --     This option causes strings to treat all the following  arguments
	      as files.

       -o     Preceded each string by its offset in the file (in decimal).

       -t format
	      Write  each string preceded by its byte offset from the start of
	      the file.  The format shall be dependent on the single character
	      used as the format option-argument:

       d      The offset shall be written in decimal.

       o      The offset shall be written in octal.

       x      The offset shall be written in hexadecimal.

       -number
	      The  decimal  number is used as the minimum string length rather
	      than the default of 4.

       -n number
	      Specify the minimum string length, where the number argument  is
	      a positive decimal integer. The default shall be 4.

       -arch arch_type
	      Specifies   the	architecture,	arch_type,  of	the  file  for
	      strings(1) to operate on when the  file  is  a  universal  file.
	      (See  arch(3) for the currently know arch_types.)  The arch_type
	      can be "all" to operate on all architectures in the file.

BUGS
       The algorithm for identifying strings is extremely primitive.
