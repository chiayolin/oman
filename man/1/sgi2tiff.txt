NAME
       sgi2tiff - create a TIFF file from an SGI image file

SYNOPSIS
       sgi2tiff [ options ] input.rgb output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       sgi2tiff  converts a file in the SGI image format to TIFF.  By default,
       the TIFF image is created with data  samples  packed  (PlanarConfigura-
       tion=1),  compressed  with  the	Lempel-Ziv & Welch algorithm (Compres-
       sion=5), and with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.	These  charac-
       teristics  can  overridden,  or	explicitly  specified with the options
       described below.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify a compression scheme to use when writing image data:  -c
	      none  for  no compression, -c packbits for the PackBits compres-
	      sion algorithm), -c jpeg for the baseline JPEG compression algo-
	      rithm,  -c zip for the Deflate compression algorithm, and -c lzw
	      for Lempel-Ziv & Welch (the default).

       -p     Explicitly select the planar configuration  used	in  organizing
	      data  samples  in the output image: -p contig for samples packed
	      contiguously, and -p separate for samples stored separately.  By
	      default samples are packed.

       -r     Write data with a specified number of rows per strip; by default
	      the number of rows/strip is  selected  so  that  each  strip  is
	      approximately 8 kilobytes.

BUGS
       Does not record colormap information.
