NAME
     /usr/bin/GetFileInfo -- get attributes of files and directories (DEPRE-
     CATED)

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/GetFileInfo [-P -a[<attribute-letter>] | -c | -d | -m | -t] file
			  ...

DESCRIPTION
     Tools supporting Carbon development, including /usr/bin/GetFileInfo, were
     deprecated with Xcode 6.

     /usr/bin/GetFileInfo is a tool to get the file attributes.

     With no flags, GetFileInfo retrieves all information about the file.  If
     exactly one option is provided, GetFileInfo retrieves and displays just
     that information; supplying more than one is an error.

     Flags:

     -P  Acts on a symlink file instead of the file the symlink resolves to.

     -a[<attribute-letter>]
		    Gets a file's attribute bits where <attribute-letter> is
		    one of the following:

		    a	     Alias file

		    b	     Has bundle

		    c	     Custom icon (allowed on folders)

		    d	     Located on the desktop (allowed on folders)

		    e	     Extension is hidden (allowed on folders)

		    i	     Inited - Finder is aware of this file and has
			     given it a location in a window. (allowed on
			     folders)

		    l	     Locked

		    m	     Shared (can run multiple times)

		    n	     File has no INIT resource

		    s	     System file (name locked)

		    t	     "Stationery Pad" file

		    v	     Invisible (allowed on folders)

		    z	     Busy (allowed on folders)

		    The value of a single attribute is printed as 0 for off or
		    false, 1 for on or true.  If no attribute letter is speci-
		    fied, the value of all attributes is returned, with lower-
		    case letters representing off or false, and uppercase rep-
		    resenting on or true.

     -t 	    Gets the file type, a string of exactly four characters.
		    If the type is not set, these will display as an empty
		    pair of quotation marks.  Directories do not have types,
		    so the type will be skipped if all information is being
		    displayed; specifying -t for a directory is an error.

     -c 	    Gets the file's creator, a string of four characters
		    enclosed in quotation marks.  If the creator is not set,
		    these will display as an empty pair of quotation marks.
		    Directories do not have creators, so the creator will be
		    skipped if all information is being displayed; specifying
		    -c for a directory is an error.

     -d 	    Gets the creation date, a string of the form "mm/dd/yyyy
		    hh:mm:ss" in 24-hour clock format.

     -m 	    Gets the modification date, a string of the form
		    "mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss" in 24-hour clock format.

RETURN VALUES
     0	      success
     1	      syntax error
     2	      any other error

EXAMPLES
     The following command line gets and prints the creator for the "Late
     Breaking News" file:

     /Developer/Tools/GetFileInfo -c "Late Breaking News"

     This command line prints the modification date of "myFile":

     /Developer/Tools/GetFileInfo -m myFile
