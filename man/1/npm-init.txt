NAME
       npm-init - Interactively create a package.json file

SYNOPSIS
	 npm init [-f|--force|-y|--yes]

DESCRIPTION
       This  will  ask you a bunch of questions, and then write a package.json
       for you.

       It attempts to make reasonable guesses about what you want things to be
       set  to,  and  then  writes a package.json file with the options you've
       selected.

       If you already have a package.json file, it'll  read  that  first,  and
       default to the options in there.

       It  is strictly additive, so it does not delete options from your pack-
       age.json without a really good reason to do so.

       If you invoke it with -f, --force, -y,  or  --yes,  it  will  use  only
       defaults and not prompt you for any options.

CONFIGURATION
   scope
       o Default: none

       o Type: String
