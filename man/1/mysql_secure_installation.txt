NAME
       mysql_secure_installation - improve MySQL installation security

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_secure_installation

DESCRIPTION
       This program enables you to improve the security of your MySQL
       installation in the following ways:

       o   You can set a password for root accounts.

       o   You can remove root accounts that are accessible from outside the
	   local host.

       o   You can remove anonymous-user accounts.

       o   You can remove the test database (which by default can be accessed
	   by all users, even anonymous users), and privileges that permit
	   anyone to access databases with names that start with test_.

       mysql_secure_installation helps you implement security recommendations
       similar to those described at Section 2.10.4, "Securing the Initial
       MySQL Accounts".

       Invoke mysql_secure_installation without arguments:

	   shell> mysql_secure_installation

       When executed, the script prompts you to determine which actions to
       perform.
