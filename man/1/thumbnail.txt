NAME
       thumbnail - create a TIFF file with thumbnail images

SYNOPSIS
       thumbnail [ options ] input.tif output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       thumbnail is a program written to show how one might use the SubIFD tag
       (#330) to store thumbnail images.  thumbnail copies a TIFF Class F fac-
       simile  file  to  the output file and for each image an 8-bit greyscale
       thumbnail sketch.  The output file contains the	thumbnail  image  with
       the associated full-resolution page linked below with the SubIFD tag.

       By  default,  thumbnail	images are 216 pixels wide by 274 pixels high.
       Pixels are calculated by sampling and filtering the  input  image  with
       each pixel value passed through a contrast curve.

OPTIONS
       -w     Specify the width of thumbnail images in pixels.

       -h     Specify the height of thumbnail images in pixels.

       -c     Specify  a  contrast  curve to apply in generating the thumbnail
	      images.  By default pixels values are passed  through  a	linear
	      contrast	curve that simply maps the pixel value ranges.	Alter-
	      native curves are: exp50 for a 50% exponential curve, exp60  for
	      a  60%  exponential  curve,  exp70  for a 70% exponential curve,
	      exp80 for a 80% exponential curve, exp90 for a  90%  exponential
	      curve,  exp  for	a  pure exponential curve, linear for a linear
	      curve.

BUGS
       There are no options to control	the  format  of  the  saved  thumbnail
       images.
