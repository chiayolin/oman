NAME
       ascii - report character aliases

SYNOPSIS
       ascii [-dxohv] [-t] [char-alias...]

OPTIONS
       Called with no options, ascii behaves like `ascii -h'. Options are as
       follows:

       -t
	   Script-friendly mode, emits only ISO/decimal/hex/octal/binary
	   encodings of the character.

       -s
	   Parse multiple characters. Convenient way of parsing strings.

       -d
	   Ascii table in decimal.

       -x
	   Ascii table in hex.

       -o
	   Ascii table in octal.

       -h, -?
	   Show summary of options and a simple ASCII table.

       -v
	   Show version of program.

DESCRIPTION
       Characters in the ASCII set can have many aliases, depending on
       context. A character's possible names include:

       o   Its bit pattern (binary representation).

       o   Its hex, decimal and octal representations.

       o   Its teletype mnemonic and caret-notation form (for control chars).

       o   Its backlash-escape form in C (for some control chars).

       o   Its printed form (for printables).

       o   Its full ISO official name in English.

       o   Its ISO/ECMA code table reference.

       o   Its name as an HTML/SGML entity.

       o   Slang and other names in wide use for it among hackers.

       This utility accepts command-line strings and tries to interpret them
       as one of the above. When it finds a value, it prints all of the names
       of the character. The constructs in the following list can be used to
       specify character values. If an argument could be interpreted in two or
       more ways, names for all the different characters it might be are
       dumped.

       character
	   Any character not described by one of the following conventions
	   represents the character itself.

       ^character
	   A caret followed by a character.

       \[abfnrtv0]
	   A backslash followed by certain special characters (abfnrtv).

       mnemonic
	   An ASCII teletype mnemonic.

       hexadecimal
	   A hexadecimal (hex) sequence consists of one or two
	   case-insensitive hex digit characters (01234567890abcdef). To
	   ensure hex interpretation use hexh,0xhex,xhex or \xhex.

       decimal
	   A decimal sequence consists of one, two or three decimal digit
	   characters (0123456789). To ensure decimal interpretation use
	   \0ddecimal,ddecimal, or \ddecimal.

       octal
	   An octal sequence consists of one, two or three octal digit
	   characters (01234567). To ensure octal interpretation use
	   \<octal>,0o<octal>,o<octal>, or \o<octal>.

       bit pattern
	   A bit pattern (binary) sequence consists of one to eight binary
	   digit characters (01). To ensure bit interpretation use 0b<bit
	   pattern>,b<bit pattern> or \b<bit pattern>.

       ISO/ECMA code
	   An ISO/ECMA code sequence consists of one or two decimal digit
	   characters, a slash, and one or two decimal digit characters.

       name
	   An official ASCII or (unofficial) slang name.

       The slang names recognized and printed out are from a rather
       comprehensive list that first appeared on USENET in early 1990 and has
       been continuously updated since. Mnemonics recognized and printed
       include the official ASCII set, some official ISO names (where those
       differ) and a few common-use alternatives (such as NL for LF).
       HTML/SGML entity names are also printed when applicable. All
       comparisons are case-insensitive, and dashes are mapped to spaces. Any
       unrecognized arguments or out of range values are silently ignored.
       Note that the -s option will not recognize 'long' names, as it cannot
       differentiate them from other parts of the string.

       For correct results, be careful to stringize or quote shell
       metacharacters in arguments (especially backslash).

       This utility is particularly handy for interpreting cc(1)'s ugly octal
       `invalid-character' messages, or when coding anything to do with serial
       communications. As a side effect it serves as a handy base-converter
       for random 8-bit values.
