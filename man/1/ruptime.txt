RUPTIME(1)		  BSD General Commands Manual		    RUPTIME(1)

NAME
     ruptime -- show host status of local machines

SYNOPSIS
     ruptime [-alrtu] [host ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The ruptime utility gives a status line like uptime(1) for each machine
     on the local network; these are formed from packets broadcast by each
     host on the network once every three minutes.

     If no operands are given, ruptime displays uptime status for all
     machines; otherwise only those hosts specified on the command line are
     displayed.  If hosts are specified on the command line, the sort order is
     equivalent to the order hosts were specified on the command line.

     Machines for which no status report has been received for 11 minutes are
     shown as being down, and machines for which no status report has been
     received for 4 days are not shown in the list at all.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Include all users.  By default, if a user has not typed to the
	     system for an hour or more, then the user will be omitted from
	     the output.

     -l      Sort by load average.

     -r      Reverse the sort order.

     -t      Sort by uptime.

     -u      Sort by number of users.

     The default listing is sorted by host name.
