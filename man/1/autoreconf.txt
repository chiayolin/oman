NAME
       autoreconf - Update generated configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       autoreconf [OPTION]... [DIRECTORY]...

DESCRIPTION
       Run  `autoconf'	(and  `autoheader', `aclocal', `automake', `autopoint'
       (formerly `gettextize'), and `glibtoolize' where  appropriate)  repeat-
       edly  to remake the GNU Build System files in specified DIRECTORIES and
       their subdirectories (defaulting to `.').

       By default, it only remakes those  files  that  are  older  than  their
       sources.   If you install new versions of the GNU Build System, you can
       make `autoreconf' remake all of the files by giving  it	the  `--force'
       option.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
	      print this help, then exit

       -V, --version
	      print version number, then exit

       -v, --verbose
	      verbosely report processing

       -d, --debug
	      don't remove temporary files

       -f, --force
	      consider all files obsolete

       -i, --install
	      copy missing auxiliary files

       --no-recursive
	      don't rebuild sub-packages

       -s, --symlink
	      with -i, install symbolic links instead of copies

       -m, --make
	      when applicable, re-run ./configure && make

       -W, --warnings=CATEGORY
	      report the warnings falling in CATEGORY [syntax]

   Warning categories include:
       `cross'
	      cross compilation issues

       `gnu'  GNU coding standards (default in gnu and gnits modes)
