NAME
       mysqlhotcopy - a database backup program

SYNOPSIS
       mysqlhotcopy arguments

DESCRIPTION
	   Note
	   This utility is deprecated in MySQL 5.6.20 and removed in MySQL 5.7

       mysqlhotcopy is a Perl script that was originally written and
       contributed by Tim Bunce. It uses FLUSH TABLES, LOCK TABLES, and cp or
       scp to make a database backup. It is a fast way to make a backup of the
       database or single tables, but it can be run only on the same machine
       where the database directories are located.  mysqlhotcopy works only
       for backing up MyISAM and ARCHIVE tables. It runs on Unix.

       To use mysqlhotcopy, you must have read access to the files for the
       tables that you are backing up, the SELECT privilege for those tables,
       the RELOAD privilege (to be able to execute FLUSH TABLES), and the LOCK
       TABLES privilege (to be able to lock the tables).

	   shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name [/path/to/new_directory]

	   shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name_1 ... db_name_n /path/to/new_directory

       Back up tables in the given database that match a regular expression:

	   shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name./regex/

       The regular expression for the table name can be negated by prefixing
       it with a tilde ("~"):

	   shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name./~regex/

       mysqlhotcopy supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysqlhotcopy] and [client] groups of an
       option file. For information about option files used by MySQL programs,
       see Section 4.2.6, "Using Option Files".

       o   --help, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --addtodest

	   Do not rename target directory (if it exists); merely add files to
	   it.

       o   --allowold

	   Do not abort if a target exists; rename it by adding an _old
	   suffix.

       o   --checkpoint=db_name.tbl_name

	   Insert checkpoint entries into the specified database db_name and
	   table tbl_name.

       o   --chroot=path

	   Base directory of the chroot jail in which mysqld operates. The
	   path value should match that of the --chroot option given to
	   mysqld.

       o   --debug

	   Enable debug output.

       o   --dryrun, -n

	   Report actions without performing them.

       o   --flushlog

	   Flush logs after all tables are locked.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

	   The host name of the local host to use for making a TCP/IP
	   connection to the local server. By default, the connection is made
	   to localhost using a Unix socket file.

       o   --keepold

	   Do not delete previous (renamed) target when done.

       o   --method=command

	   The method for copying files (cp or scp). The default is cp.

       o   --noindices

	   Do not include full index files for MyISAM tables in the backup.
	   This makes the backup smaller and faster. The indexes for reloaded
	   tables can be reconstructed later with myisamchk -rq.

       o   --password=password, -ppassword

	   The password to use when connecting to the server. The password
	   value is not optional for this option, unlike for other MySQL
	   programs.

	   Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
	   insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
	   Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
	   on the command line.

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

	   The TCP/IP port number to use when connecting to the local server.

       o   --old_server

	   In MySQL 5.6, mysqlhotcopy uses FLUSH TABLES tbl_list WITH READ
	   LOCK to flush and lock tables. Use the --old_server option if the
	   server is older than 5.5.3, which is when that statement was
	   introduced.

       o   --quiet, -q

	   Be silent except for errors.

       o   --record_log_pos=db_name.tbl_name

	   Record master and slave status in the specified database db_name
	   and table tbl_name.

       o   --regexp=expr

	   Copy all databases with names that match the given regular
	   expression.

       o   --resetmaster

	   Reset the binary log after locking all the tables.

       o   --resetslave

	   Reset the master info repository file or table after locking all
	   the tables.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

	   The Unix socket file to use for connections to localhost.

       o   --suffix=str

	   The suffix to use for names of copied databases.

       o   --tmpdir=path

	   The temporary directory. The default is /tmp.

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

	   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       Use perldoc for additional mysqlhotcopy documentation, including
       information about the structure of the tables needed for the
       --checkpoint and --record_log_pos options:

	   shell> perldoc mysqlhotcopy
