NAME
       mysql_fix_extensions - normalize table file name extensions

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_fix_extensions data_dir

DESCRIPTION
	   Note
	   This utility is deprecated in MySQL 5.6.17 and removed in MySQL 5.7

       mysql_fix_extensions converts the extensions for MyISAM (or ISAM) table
       files to their canonical forms. It looks for files with extensions
       matching any lettercase variant of .frm, .myd, .myi, .isd, and .ism and
       renames them to have extensions of .frm, .MYD, .MYI, .ISD, and .ISM,
       respectively. This can be useful after transferring the files from a
       system with case-insensitive file names (such as Windows) to a system
       with case-sensitive file names.

       Invoke mysql_fix_extensions like this, where data_dir is the path name
       to the MySQL data directory.

	   shell> mysql_fix_extensions data_dir
