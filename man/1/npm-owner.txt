NAME
       npm-owner - Manage package owners

SYNOPSIS
	 npm owner ls <package name>
	 npm owner add <user> <package name>
	 npm owner rm <user> <package name>

DESCRIPTION
       Manage ownership of published packages.

       o ls:  List  all the users who have access to modify a package and push
	 new versions.	Handy when you need to know who to bug for help.

       o add: Add a new user as a maintainer  of  a  package.	This  user  is
	 enabled  to modify metadata, publish new versions, and add other own-
	 ers.

       o rm: Remove a user from the  package  owner  list.   This  immediately
	 revokes their privileges.


       Note  that  there is only one level of access.  Either you can modify a
       package, or you can't.  Future versions may contain  more  fine-grained
       access levels, but that is not implemented at this time.
