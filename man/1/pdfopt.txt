NAME
       pdfopt - Ghostscript PDF Optimizer

SYNOPSIS
       pdfopt [ options ] input.pdf output.pdf

DESCRIPTION
       pdfopt  uses  gs(1) to convert the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)
       file "input.pdf" to a so-called optimized form in "output.pdf".	 Opti-
       mization  puts  the  elements  of the file into a more linear order and
       adds "hint" pointers, allowing Adobe's Acrobat(TM) products to  display
       individual  pages  of  the  file  more  quickly when accessing the file
       through a network.

       Note: input.pdf and output.pdf must not be the same.  If they are,  the
       file  will  probably be destroyed.  pdfopt currently does not check for
       this.

FILES
       Run "gs -h" to find the location of Ghostscript documentation  on  your
       system, from which you can get more details.
