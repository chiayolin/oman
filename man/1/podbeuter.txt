NAME
       podbeuter - a podcast download manage for text terminals

SYNOPSIS
       podbeuter [-C configfile] [-q queuefile] [-a] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       podbeuter is a podcast manager for text terminals. It is a helper
       program to newsbeuter which queues podcast downloads into a file. These
       queued downloads can then be download with newsbeuter.

OPTIONS
       -h
	   Display help

       -C configfile
	   Use an alternative configuration file

       -q queuefile
	   Use an alternative queue file

       -a
	   Start automatic download of all queued files on startup

PODCAST SUPPORT
       A podcast is a media file distributed over the internet using
       syndication feeds such as RSS, for later playback on portable players
       or computers. Newsbeuter contains support for downloading and saving
       podcasts. This support differs a bit from other podcast aggregators or
       "podcatchers" in how it is done.

       Podcast content is transported in RSS feeds via special tags called
       "enclosures". Newsbeuter recognizes these enclosures and stores the
       relevant information for every podcast item it finds in an RSS feed.
       Since version 2.0, it also recognizes and handles the Yahoo Media RSS
       extensions. What the user then can do is to add the podcast download
       URL to a download queue. Alternatively, newsbeuter can be configured to
       automatically do that. This queue is stored in the file
       $HOME/.newsbeuter/queue.

       The user can then use the download manager "podbeuter" to download
       these files to a directory on the local filesystem. Podbeuter comes
       with the newsbeuter package, and features a look and feel very close to
       the one of newsbeuter. It also shares the same configuration file.

       Podcasts that have been downloaded but haven't been played yet remain
       in the queue but are marked as downloaded. You can remove them by
       purging them from the queue with the P key. After you've played a file
       and close podbeuter, it will be removed from the queue. The downloaded
       file remains on the filesystem.

CONFIGURATION COMMANDS
       download-path (parameters: <path>; default value: ~/)
	   Specifies the directory where podbeuter shall download the files
	   to. Optionally, the placeholders "%n" (for the podcast feed's name)
	   and "%h" (for the podcast feed's hostname) can be used to place
	   downloads in a directory structure. (example: download-path
	   "~/Downloads/%h/%n")

       max-downloads (parameters: <number>; default value: 1)
	   Specifies the maximum number of parallel downloads when automatic
	   download is enabled. (example: max-downloads 3)

       player (parameters: <player command>; default value: "")
	   Specifies the player that shall be used for playback of downloaded
	   files. (example: player "mp3blaster")

FILES
       $HOME/.newsbeuter/config

       $HOME/.newsbeuter/queue
