NAME
       tiff2ps - convert a TIFF image to PostScripttm

SYNOPSIS
       tiff2ps [ options ] input.tif ...

DESCRIPTION
       tiff2ps	reads  TIFF images and writes PostScript or Encapsulated Post-
       Script (EPS) on the standard output.  By default, tiff2ps writes Encap-
       sulated	PostScript  for  the  first  image in the specified TIFF image
       file.

       By default, tiff2ps will generate PostScript that fills a printed  area
       specified  by  the  TIFF  tags in the input file.  If the file does not
       contain XResolution or YResolution tags, then the printed area  is  set
       according  to  the image dimensions.  The -w and -h options (see below)
       can be used to set the dimensions of the printed area in inches;  over-
       riding any relevant TIFF tags.

       The  PostScript	generated  for	RGB, palette, and CMYK images uses the
       colorimage  operator.   The  PostScript	generated  for	greyscale  and
       bilevel	images	uses the image operator.  When the colorimage operator
       is used, PostScript code to emulate this operator on  older  PostScript
       printers  is also generated.  Note that this emulation code can be very
       slow.

       Color images with associated alpha data are  composited	over  a  white
       background.

OPTIONS
       -1     Generate PostScript Level 1 (the default).

       -2     Generate PostScript Level 2.

       -3     Generate	PostScript Level 3. It basically allows one to use the
	      /flateDecode filter for ZIP compressed TIFF images.

       -8     Disable use of ASCII85 encoding with PostScript Level 2/3.

       -a     Generate output for all IFDs (pages) in the input file.

       -b     Specify the bottom margin for the output (in inches). This  does
	      not affect the height of the printed image.

       -c     Center the image in the output. This option only shows an effect
	      if both the -w and the -h option are given.

       -C     Specify the document creator name.

       -d     Set the initial TIFF directory to the specified  directory  num-
	      ber.   (NB:  Directories	are  numbered starting at zero.)  This
	      option is useful for selecting individual pages in a  multi-page
	      (e.g. facsimile) file.

       -D     Enable duplex printing (two pages per sheet of paper).

       -e     Force the generation of Encapsulated PostScript (implies -z).

       -h     Specify the vertical size of the printed area (in inches).

       -H     Specify  the  maximum  height  of image (in inches). Images with
	      larger sizes will be split in several pages. Option  -L  may  be
	      used  for  specifying  size  of  split  images  overlapping.  -i
	      Enable/disable pixel interpolation.  This option requires a sin-
	      gle  numeric value: zero to disable pixel interpolation and non-
	      zero to enable.  The default is enabled.

       -L     Specify the size of overlapping for split  images  (in  inches).
	      Used in conjunction with -H and -W options.

       -l     Specify  the  left  margin for the output (in inches). This does
	      not affect the width of the printed image.

       -m     Where possible render using the  imagemask  PostScript  operator
	      instead  of  the	image operator.  When this option is specified
	      tiff2ps will use imagemask for rendering 1 bit deep images.   If
	      this  option  is	not specified or if the image depth is greater
	      than 1 then the image operator is used.

       -o     Set the initial TIFF directory to the IFD at the specified  file
	      offset.	This  option  is useful for selecting thumbnail images
	      and the like which are hidden using the SubIFD tag.

       -O     Write PostScript to specified file instead of standard output.

       -p     Force the generation of (non-Encapsulated) PostScript.

       -P L|P Set optional PageOrientation DSC comment to  Landscape  or  Por-
	      trait.

       -r 90|180|270|auto
	      Rotate  image  by  90, 180, 270 degrees or auto.	Auto picks the
	      best fit for the image on the specified paper size (eg  portrait
	      or  landscape)  if -h or -w is specified. Rotation is in degrees
	      counterclockwise. Auto rotates 90 degrees ccw to	produce  land-
	      scape.

       -s     Generate output for a single IFD (page) in the input file.

       -t     Specify the document title string.

       -T     Print pages for top edge binding.

       -w     Specify the horizontal size of the printed area (in inches).

       -W     Specify  the  maximum  width  of	image (in inches). Images with
	      larger sizes will be split in several pages. Options -L  and  -W
	      are mutually exclusive.

       -x     Override	resolution units specified in the TIFF as centimeters.

       -y     Override resolution units specified in the TIFF as inches.

       -z     When generating PostScript Level 2, data is scaled  so  that  it
	      does  not  image	into  the deadzone on a page (the outer margin
	      that the printing device is unable to mark).  This  option  sup-
	      presses  this  behavior.	 When PostScript Level 1 is generated,
	      data is imaged to the entire printed page and this option has no
	      affect.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  generates PostScript Level 2 for all pages of a facsim-
       ile:
	      tiff2ps -a2 fax.tif | lpr
       Note also that if you have version 2.6.1 or newer of  Ghostscript  then
       you can efficiently preview facsimile generated with the above command.

       To generate Encapsulated PostScript for a the image at directory  2  of
       an image use:
	      tiff2ps -d 1 foo.tif
       (Notice that directories are numbered starting at zero.)

       If you have a long image, it may be split in several pages:
	      tiff2ps -h11 -w8.5 -H14 -L.5 foo.tif > foo.ps
       The  page  size is set to 8.5x11 by -w and -h options. We will accept a
       small amount of vertical compression,  so  -H  set  to  14.  Any  pages
       between	11 and 14 inches will be fit onto one page.  Pages longer than
       14 inches are cut off at 11 and continued on the next  page.  The  -L.5
       option  says  to  repeat a half inch on the next page (to improve read-
       ability).

BUGS
       Because PostScript does not support the notion  of  a  colormap,  8-bit
       palette	images	produce  24-bit  PostScript  images.   This conversion
       results in output that is six times bigger than the original image  and
       which  takes a long time to send to a printer over a serial line.  Mat-
       ters are even worse for 4-, 2-, and 1-bit palette images.

       Does not handle tiled images when generating PostScript Level I output.
