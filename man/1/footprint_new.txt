NAME
     footprint_new -- gathers memory information about one or more processes

SYNOPSIS
     footprint_new [-j] [-t] [-s] [-v] ( -a | <process name | pid> [ ... ] )
     footprint_new -h

DESCRIPTION
     The footprint_new utility gathers and displays memory consumption infor-
     mation for the specified processes.

     footprint_new will display all addressable memory used by the specified
     processes, but it emphasizes anonymous and wired memory.  If multiple
     processes are specified, footprint_new will de-duplicate multiply mapped
     objects and will display shared objects separately from private ones.

     Because it is inspecting the address space of other processes,
     footprint_new must be run as root.

OPTIONS
     -a      target all processes (will take much longer)

     -j      format output in JSON instead of structured text

     -t      in addition to the supplied processes, target their children,
	     grandchildren, etc.

     -s      skip processes that are dirty tracked and have no outstanding XPC
	     transactions (i.e., are "clean")

     -v      display vmmap-like output of address space layout

     -h      display help and exit
