NAME
       pagestuff - Mach-O file page analysis tool

SYNOPSIS
       pagestuff file [-arch arch_flag] [-a] [-p] [pagenumber...]

DESCRIPTION
       pagestuff  displays  information about the specified logical pages of a
       file conforming to the Mach-O executable format.   For  each  specified
       page  of  code,	symbols (function and static data structure names) are
       displayed.  If no pages are specified, symbols for  all	pages  in  the
       __TEXT, __text section are displayed.

       The options to pagestuff(1) are:

       -arch arch_type
	      Specifies   the	architecture,	arch_type,  of	the  file  for
	      pagestuff(1) to operate on when the file is  a  universal  file.
	      (See  arch(3)  for  the  currently  know arch_types.)  When this
	      option is used the page numbers are  the	logical  page  numbers
	      starting	at  zero  for the offset that architecture starts in a
	      universal file.

       -a     Displays all pages.  All other arguments are ignored.

       -p     Print a list of the sections of the specified Mach-O file,  with
	      offsets  and  lengths.   All  other arguments are ignored.  Note
	      that the size(1) tool given arguments "-m -l -x" displays a much
	      more concise listing.
