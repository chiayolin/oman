NAME
     /usr/bin/SetFile -- set attributes of files and directories (DEPRECATED)

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/SetFile [-P] [-a attributes] [-c creator] [-d date] [-m date]
		      [-t type] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     Tools supporting Carbon development, including /usr/bin/SetFile, were
     deprecated with Xcode 6.

     /usr/bin/SetFile is a tool to set the file attributes on files in an HFS+
     directory. It attempts to be similar to the setfile command in MPW. It
     can apply rules to more than one file with the options applying to all
     files listed.

     Flags:

     -P  Acts on a symlink file instead on the file the symlink resolves to.

     -a attributes  Sets the file attributes bits where attributes is a string
		    of case sensitive letters. Each letter corresponds to a
		    file attribute: an uppercase letter indicates that the
		    attribute bit is set (1), a lowercase letter indicates
		    that it is not (0).  Note: attributes not specified remain
		    unchanged.

		    A | a    Alias file

		    B | b    Has bundle

		    C | c    Custom icon (allowed on folders)

		    D | d    Located on the desktop (allowed on folders)

		    E | e    Extension is hidden (allowed on folders)

		    I | i    Inited - Finder is aware of this file and has
			     given it a location in a window. (allowed on
			     folders)

		    L | l    Locked

		    M | m    Shared (can run multiple times)

		    N | n    File has no INIT resource

		    S | s    System file (name locked)

		    T | t    "Stationery Pad" file

		    V | v    Invisible (allowed on folders)

		    Z | z    Busy (allowed on folders)

     -c creator     Specifies the file's creator, where creator can be a
		    string of four MacRoman characters, an empty string ('')
		    designating a null creator, or a binary, decimal, octal,
		    or hexadecimal number in standard notation (e.g.
		    0x52486368).

     -d date	    Sets the creation date, where date is a string of the
		    form: "mm/dd/[yy]yy [hh:mm:[:ss] [AM | PM]]" Notes:
		    Enclose the string in quotation marks if it contains spa-
		    ces. The date must be in the Unix epoch, that is, between
		    1/1/1970 and 1/18/2038. If the year is provided as a two-
		    digit year, it is assumed to be in the 21st century and
		    must be from 00 (2000) through 38 (2038).

     -m date	    Sets the modification date where date is a string of the
		    form in -d above. (mm/dd/[yy]yy [hh:mm:[:ss] [AM | PM]])

     -t type	    Sets the file type, where type can be a string of four
		    MacRoman characters, an empty string ('') designating a
		    null type, or a binary, decimal, octal, or hexadecimal
		    number in standard notation (e.g. 0x55455955).

     0	      attributes set
     1	      syntax error
     2	      any other error
