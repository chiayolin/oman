NAME
     iconutil -- Utility to convert between '.iconset' and '.icns' files.

SYNOPSIS
     iconutil -c {icns | iconset} [-o file] file

DESCRIPTION
     iconutil converts between '.iconset' and '.icns' files. The tool takes a
     single source '.icns' file or '.iconset' and converts it to either a
     '.icns' or '.iconset' depending on the value of the -c flag's argument.
     It is possible to specify the name of the output file by passing the file
     path as the argument to the -o flag. If -o is not set iconutil will write
     converted '.icns' file or '.iconset' to the same directory as the source
     file using the same file name with the correct extension for the output
     type.

OPTIONS
     -c --convert {icns | iconset}
	      Given the argument iconset, iconutil converts the source '.icns'
	      file to an '.iconset'.  The '.iconset' is saved in the same
	      directory as the source '.icns'. It is given the same file name
	      as but with the '.iconset' file extension.  If the argument is
	      icns, iconutil converts the source '.iconset' to an '.icns'.
	      The '.icns' is saved in the same directory as the source '.icon-
	      set'. It is given the same file name as the source file but with
	      the '.iconset' file extension.

     -o --output
	      Overrides the default output file name that iconutil uses to
	      save the converted '.iconset' or '.icns' files.
