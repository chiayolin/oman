NAME
       mysqltest - program to run test cases
       mysqltest_embedded - program to run embedded test cases

SYNOPSIS
       mysqltest [options] [db_name]

       mysqltest_embedded [options] [db_name]

DESCRIPTION
       The mysqltest program runs a test case against a MySQL server and
       optionally compares the output with a result file. This program reads
       input written in a special test language. Typically, you invoke
       mysqltest using mysql-test-run.pl rather than invoking it directly.

       mysqltest_embedded is similar but is built with support for the
       libmysqld embedded server.

       Features of mysqltest:

       o   Can send SQL statements to MySQL servers for execution

       o   Can execute external shell commands

       o   Can test whether the result from an SQL statement or shell command
	   is as expected

       o   Can connect to one or more standalone mysqld servers and switch
	   between connections

       o   Can connect to an embedded server (libmysqld), if MySQL is compiled
	   with support for libmysqld. (In this case, the executable is named
	   mysqltest_embedded rather than mysqltest.)

       By default, mysqltest reads the test case on the standard input. To run
       mysqltest this way, you normally invoke it like this:

	   shell> mysqltest [options] [db_name] < test_file

       You can also name the test case file with a --test-file=file_name
       option.

       The exit value from mysqltest is 0 for success, 1 for failure, and 62
       if it skips the test case (for example, if after checking some
       preconditions it decides not to run the test).

       mysqltest supports the following options:

       o   --help, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --basedir=dir_name, -b dir_name

	   The base directory for tests.

       o   --character-sets-dir=path

	   The directory where character sets are installed.

       o   --compress, -C

	   Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
	   both support compression.

       o   --cursor-protocol

	   Use cursors for prepared statements.

       o   --database=db_name, -D db_name

	   The default database to use.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -#[debug_options]

	   Write a debugging log if MySQL is built with debugging support. The
	   default debug_options value is 'd:t:S:i:O,/tmp/mysqltest.trace'.

       o   --debug-check

	   Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       o   --debug-info

	   Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics
	   when the program exits.

       o   --explain-protocol,

	   Run EXPLAIN EXTENDED on all SELECT, INSERT, REPLACE, UPDATE and
	   DELETE queries.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

	   Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o   --include=file_name, -i file_name

	   Include the contents of the given file before processing the
	   contents of the test file. The included file should have the same
	   format as other mysqltest test files. This option has the same
	   effect as putting a --source file_name command as the first line of
	   the test file.

       o   --json-explain-protocol,

	   Run EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON on all SELECT, INSERT, REPLACE, UPDATE and
	   DELETE queries. The json-explain-protocol option is available from
	   MySQL 5.6.

       o   --logdir=dir_name

	   The directory to use for log files.

       o   --mark-progress

	   Write the line number and elapsed time to test_file.progress.

       o   --max-connect-retries=num

	   The maximum number of connection attempts when connecting to
	   server.

       o   --max-connections=num

	   The maximum number of simultaneous server connections per client
	   (that is, per test). If not set, the maximum is 128. Minimum
	   allowed limit is 8, maximum is 5120.

       o   --no-defaults

	   Do not read default options from any option files. If used, this
	   must be the first option.

       o   --plugin-dir=path

	   The directory in which to look for plugins. It may be necessary to
	   specify this option if the default_auth argument is used for the
	   connect() command to specify an authentication plugin but mysqltest
	   does not find it. This option was added in MySQL 5.5.7.

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

	   The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
	   short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
	   and the password. If you omit the password value following the
	   --password or -p option on the command line, you are prompted for
	   one.

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

	   The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

	   Choose the protocol for communication with the server.  SOCKET is
	   default.

	   The --protocol option is ignored if running with the embedded
	   server.

       o   --ps-protocol

	   Use the prepared-statement protocol for communication.

       o   --quiet

	   Suppress all normal output. This is a synonym for --silent.

       o   --record, -r

	   Record the output that results from running the test file into the
	   file named by the --result-file option, if that option is given. It
	   is an error to use this option without also using --result-file.

       o   --result-file=file_name, -R file_name

	   This option specifies the file for test case expected results.
	   --result-file, together with --record, determines how mysqltest
	   treats the test actual and expected results for a test case:

	   o   If the test produces no results, mysqltest exits with an error
	       message to that effect, unless --result-file is given and the
	       named file is an empty file.

	   o   Otherwise, if --result-file is not given, mysqltest sends test
	       results to the standard output.

	   o   With --result-file but not --record, mysqltest reads the
	       expected results from the given file and compares them with the
	       actual results. If the results do not match, mysqltest writes a
	       .reject file in the same directory as the result file, outputs
	       a diff of the two files, and exits with an error.

	   o   With both --result-file and --record, mysqltest updates the
	       given file by writing the actual test results to it.

       o   --server-arg=value, -A value

	   Pass the argument as an argument to the embedded server. For
	   example, --server-arg=--tmpdir=/tmp or --server-arg=--core. Up to
	   64 arguments can be given.

       o   --server-file=file_name, -F file_name

	   Read arguments for the embedded server from the given file. The
	   file should contain one argument per line.

       o   --server-public-key-path=file_name

	   The path name to a file containing the server RSA public key. The
	   file must be in PEM format. The public key is used for RSA
	   encryption of the client password for connections to the server
	   made using accounts that authenticate with the sha256_password
	   plugin. This option is ignored for client accounts that do not
	   authenticate with that plugin. It is also ignored if password
	   encryption is not needed, as is the case when the client connects
	   to the server using an SSL connection.

	   The server sends the public key to the client as needed, so it is
	   not necessary to use this option for RSA password encryption to
	   occur. It is more efficient to do so because then the server need
	   not send the key.

	   For additional discussion regarding use of the sha256_password
	   plugin, including how to get the RSA public key, see The SHA-256
	   Authentication Plugin[1].

	   This option is available only if MySQL was built using OpenSSL. It
	   was added in MySQL 5.6.6 under the name --server-public-key and
	   renamed in 5.6.7 to --server-public-key-path.

       o   --silent, -s

	   Suppress all normal output.

       o   --skip-safemalloc

	   Do not use memory allocation checking.

       o   --sleep=num, -T num

	   Cause all sleep commands in the test case file to sleep num
	   seconds. This option does not affect real_sleep commands.

	   An option value of 0 can also be used, which effectively disables
	   sleep commands in the test case.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

	   The socket file to use when connecting to localhost (which is the
	   default host).

       o   --sp-protocol

	   Execute DML statements within a stored procedure. For every DML
	   statement, mysqltest creates and invokes a stored procedure that
	   executes the statement rather than executing the statement
	   directly.

       o   --tail-lines=nn

	   Specify how many lines of the result to include in the output if
	   the test fails because an SQL statement fails. The default is 0,
	   meaning no lines of result printed.

       o   --test-file=file_name, -x file_name

	   Read test input from this file. The default is to read from the
	   standard input.

       o   --timer-file=file_name, -m file_name

	   If given, the number of millisecond spent running the test will be
	   written to this file. This is used by mysql-test-run.pl for its
	   reporting.

       o   --tmpdir=dir_name, -t dir_name

	   The temporary directory where socket files are created.

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

	   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --verbose, -v

	   Verbose mode. Print out more information about what the program
	   does.

       o   --version, -V

	   Display version information and exit.

       o   --view-protocol

	   Every SELECT statement is wrapped inside a view.
