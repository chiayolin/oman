NAME
       ntp-keygen - Create a NTP host key

SYNOPSIS
       ntp-keygen [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name [[=| ]value]]...

       All arguments must be options.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the ntp-keygen command.  If there is
       no new host key, look for an existing one.  If one is not found, create
       it.

OPTIONS
       -c scheme, --certificate=scheme
	      certificate scheme.

	      scheme  is one of RSA-MD2, RSA-MD5, RSA-SHA, RSA-SHA1, RSA-MDC2,
	      RSA-RIPEMD160, DSA-SHA, or DSA-SHA1.

	      Select  the  certificate	message  digest/signature   encryption
	      scheme.	Note that RSA schemes must be used with a RSA sign key
	      and DSA schemes must be used with a DSA sign key.   The  default
	      without this option is RSA-MD5.

       -d, --debug-level
	      Increase	output debug message level.  This option may appear an
	      unlimited number of times.

	      Increase the debugging message output level.

       -D string, --set-debug-level=string
	      Set the output debug message level.  This option may  appear  an
	      unlimited number of times.

	      Set the output debugging level.  Can be supplied multiple times,
	      but each overrides the previous value(s).

       -e, --id-key
	      Write IFF or GQ identity keys.

	      Write the IFF or GQ client keys to the standard output.  This is
	      intended for automatic key distribution by mail.

       -G, --gq-params
	      Generate GQ parameters and keys.

	      Generate	parameters  and keys for the GQ identification scheme,
	      obsoleting any that may exist.

       -H, --host-key
	      generate RSA host key.

	      Generate new host keys, obsoleting any that may exist.

       -I, --iffkey
	      generate IFF parameters.

	      Generate parameters for the IFF identification scheme,  obsolet-
	      ing any that may exist.

       -i issuer-name, --issuer-name=issuer-name
	      set issuer name.

	      Set  the suject name to name.  This is used as the subject field
	      in certificates and in the file name for host and sign keys.

       -M, --md5key
	      generate MD5 keys.

	      Generate MD5 keys, obsoleting any that may exist.

       -m modulus, --modulus=modulus
	      modulus.	This option takes an integer number as	its  argument.
	      The value of modulus is constrained to being:
		  in the range	256 through 2048

	      The number of bits in the prime modulus.	The default is 512.

       -P, --pvt-cert
	      generate PC private certificate.

	      Generate a private certificate.  By default, the program gener-
	      ates public certificates.

       -p passwd, --pvt-passwd=passwd
	      output private password.

	      Encrypt generated files containing private data with the speci-
	      fied password and the DES-CBC algorithm.

       -q passwd, --get-pvt-passwd=passwd
	      input private password.

	      Set the password for reading files to the specified password.

       -S sign, --sign-key=sign
	      generate sign key (RSA or DSA).

	      Generate a new sign key of the designated type, obsoleting any
	      that may exist.  By default, the program uses the host key as
	      the sign key.

       -s host, --subject-name=host
	      set subject name.

	      Set the issuer name to name.  This is used for the issuer field
	      in certificates and in the file name for identity files.

       -T, --trusted-cert
	      trusted certificate (TC scheme).

	      Generate a trusted certificate.  By default, the program gener-
	      ates a non-trusted certificate.

       -V num, --mv-params=num
	      generate <num> MV parameters.  This option takes an integer num-
	      ber as its argument.

	      Generate parameters and keys for the Mu-Varadharajan (MV) iden-
	      tification scheme.

       -v num, --mv-keys=num
	      update <num> MV keys.  This option takes an integer number as
	      its argument.

	      This option has not been fully documented.

       -?, --help
	      Display extended usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
	      Extended usage information passed thru pager.

       -> [rcfile], --save-opts[=rcfile]
	      Save the option state to rcfile.	The default is the last con-
	      figuration file listed in the OPTION PRESETS section, below.

       -< rcfile, --load-opts=rcfile, --no-load-opts
	      Load options from rcfile.  The no-load-opts form will disable
	      the loading of earlier RC/INI files.  --no-load-opts is handled
	      early, out of order.

       - [{v|c|n}], --version[={v|c|n}]
	      Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a
	      simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information
	      and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

OPTION PRESETS
       Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by load-
       ing values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
       environment variables named:
	 NTP_KEYGEN_<option-name> or NTP_KEYGEN
       The  environmental  presets  take precedence (are processed later than)
       the configuration files.  The homerc files are "$HOME",	and  ".".   If
       any  of	these  are  directories,  then the file .ntprc is searched for
       within those directories.
