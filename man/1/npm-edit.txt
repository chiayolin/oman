NAME

SYNOPSIS
	 npm edit <name>[@<version>]

DESCRIPTION
       Opens the package folder in the default editor (or whatever you've con-
       figured as the npm editor config -- see npm help 7 npm-config.)

       changes in compiled packages.

       your package, and then npm edit connect to make a few changes  to  your
       locally installed copy.
