NAME
     ri -- Ruby API reference front end

SYNOPSIS
     ri [-Ti] [-d directory] [-f format] [--list-doc-dirs]
	[--no-standard-docs] [--[no-]{system|site|gems|home}]
	[--[no-]use-cache] [--width=width] [target ...]

DESCRIPTION
     ri is a CLI front end for the Ruby API reference.	You can search and
     read API reference for classes and methods with ri.

     ri is a part of Ruby.

     target can be one of the following forms:

	   Class  for classes

	   Class::method  for class methods

	   Class#method  for instance methods

	   Class.method  for both class and instance methods

	   method  for both class and instance methods

     All class names may be abbreviated to their minimum unambiguous form. If
     a name is ambiguous, all valid options will be listed.

     For example:

	   ri Fil
	   ri File
	   ri File.new
	   ri zip

     Note that shell quoting may be required for method names containing punc-
     tuation:

	   ri 'Array.[]'
	   ri compact

OPTIONS
     --version	    Prints the version of ri.

     -T
     --no-pager     Send output directly to stdout, rather than to a pager.

     -d directory
     --doc-dir=directory
		    List of directories from which to source documentation in
		    addition to the standard directories.  May be repeated.

     -f FORMAT
     --fmt FORMAT
     --format=FORMAT
		    Format to use when displaying output:

		    ansi, bs, html, plain, simple

		    Use 'bs' (backspace) with most pager programs. To use
		    ANSI, either disable the pager or tell the pager to allow
		    control characters.

     -i
     --interactive  This makes ri go into interactive mode.

		    When ri is in interactive mode it will allow the user to
		    disambiguate lists of methods in case multiple methods
		    match against a method search string.  It also will allow
		    the user to enter in a method name (with auto-completion,
		    if readline is supported) when viewing a class.

     --list-doc-dirs
		    List the directories from which ri will source documenta-
		    tion on stdout and exit.

     --no-standard-docs
		    Do not include documentation from the Ruby standard
		    library, site_lib, installed gems, or ~/.rdoc.

		    Equivalent to specifying the options --no-system,
		    --no-site, --no-gems, and --no-home.

     --[no-]system  Include documentation from Ruby's standard library.
		    Defaults to true.

     --[no-]site     Include documentation from libraries installed in
		    site_lib. Defaults to true.

     --[no-]gems    Include documentation from RubyGems. Defaults to true.

     --[no-]home    Include documentation stored in ~/.rdoc.  Defaults to
		    true.

     --[no-]use-cache
		    Whether or not to use ri's cache. True by default.

     -w width
     --width=width  Set the width of the output.
