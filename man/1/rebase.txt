NAME
     rebase -- Changes base address of dylibs and bundles

SYNOPSIS
     rebase [-low_address addr] [-high_address addr] [-arch arch] [-v] file(s)

DESCRIPTION
     The base address of an image (dylib or bundle) is the preferred address
     for it to be loaded.  By default all images are built with a base address
     of zero.  At runtime, if the preferred memory range is already occupied,
     dyld will "slide" the image to a new address range.  There is a small
     cost to the slide, as dyld must do some fix ups.  The rebase tool takes a
     list of images and adjust their base address to be non-overlapping. If no
     low or high address is specified, the a suitable address range is choosen
     for the architecture.

     The options are as follows:

     -low_address addr
	     Force the base address for the first image to be addr (specified
	     in hex). Each subsequent file gets the next available base
	     address.

     -high_address addr
	     Force the base address for the last image to be such that when
	     that image is loaded it occupies memory up to addr (specified in
	     hex). Each preceeding file gets the previous available base
	     address.

     -arch arch
	     Only rebase the specified architecture.  Other architectures in a
	     universal image are left as is.

     -v      Verbose. Print information about rebasing done.
