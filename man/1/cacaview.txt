NAME
       cacaview - ASCII image browser

SYNOPSIS
       cacaview [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       cacaview  is  a	lightweight  text mode image viewer. It renders images
       using colour ASCII characters. It is a powerful add-on to  famous  con-
       sole  programs  such  as the mutt email client, the slrn newsreader and
       the links or w3m web browsers.

       cacaview can load the most widespread image formats:  PNG,  JPEG,  GIF,
       PNG, BMP etc.

       You  can  zoom and scroll the image around for more details, and choose
       four different dithering modes. All commands are accessible  through  a
       single key press.

KEYS
       ?      show the help screen

       n, p   switch to next image, previous image

       Left, Right, Up, Down or h, l, k, j
	      scroll the image around

       +, -   zoom in and out

       z      reset the zoom level to normal

       f      switch fullscreen mode (hide/show menu and status bars)

       d      toggle  the dithering mode (no dithering, 4x4 ordered dithering,
	      8x8 ordered dithering and random dithering)

       q      exit the program

EXAMPLE
       cacaview /usr/share/pixmaps/*.*

BUGS
       There is no support for aspect ratio yet. Also, since there is  no  way
       yet  to	load  an image from cacaview it is completely useless when run
       without an argument.
