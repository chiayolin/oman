POSTQUEUE(1)							  POSTQUEUE(1)



NAME
       postqueue - Postfix queue control

SYNOPSIS
       postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -f
       postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -i queue_id
       postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -p
       postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -s site

DESCRIPTION
       The  postqueue(1)  command  implements  the  Postfix user interface for
       queue management.  It  implements  operations  that  are  traditionally
       available  via  the  sendmail(1) command.  See the postsuper(1) command
       for queue operations that require super-user privileges such as	delet-
       ing a message from the queue or changing the status of a message.

       The following options are recognized:

       -c config_dir
	      The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead
	      of the default configuration directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG
	      environment setting below.

       -f     Flush the queue: attempt to deliver all queued mail.

	      This option implements the traditional "sendmail -q" command, by
	      contacting the Postfix qmgr(8) daemon.

	      Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will  result  in
	      poor delivery performance of all other mail.

       -i queue_id
	      Schedule	immediate delivery of deferred mail with the specified
	      queue ID.

	      This option implements the traditional sendmail -qI command,  by
	      contacting the flush(8) server.

	      This feature is available with Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       -p     Produce a traditional sendmail-style queue listing.  This option
	      implements the traditional  mailq  command,  by  contacting  the
	      Postfix showq(8) daemon.

	      Each  queue entry shows the queue file ID, message size, arrival
	      time, sender, and the recipients that still need	to  be	deliv-
	      ered.  If mail could not be delivered upon the last attempt, the
	      reason for failure is shown. The queue ID string is followed  by
	      an optional status character:

	      *      The  message  is in the active queue, i.e. the message is
		     selected for delivery.

	      !      The message is in the hold queue, i.e. no further	deliv-
		     ery  attempt  will  be  made  until the mail is taken off
		     hold.

       -s site
	      Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is queued  for  the
	      named  site.  A  numerical site must be specified as a valid RFC
	      5321  address  literal  enclosed	in  [],  just  like  in  email
	      addresses.   The site must be eligible for the "fast flush" ser-
	      vice.  See flush(8) for more information about the "fast	flush"
	      service.

	      This  option  implements the traditional "sendmail -qRsite" com-
	      mand, by contacting the Postfix flush(8) daemon.

       -v     Enable verbose  logging  for  debugging  purposes.  Multiple  -v
	      options  make  the  software increasingly verbose. As of Postfix
	      2.3, this option is available for the super-user only.

SECURITY
       This program is designed to run with set-group ID privileges,  so  that
       it can connect to Postfix daemon processes.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems are logged to syslogd(8) and to the standard error stream.

ENVIRONMENT
       MAIL_CONFIG
	      Directory  with the main.cf file. In order to avoid exploitation
	      of set-group ID privileges, a non-standard directory is  allowed
	      only if:

	      o      The  name is listed in the standard main.cf file with the
		     alternate_config_directories configuration parameter.

	      o      The command is invoked by the super-user.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       The following main.cf parameters are especially relevant to  this  pro-
       gram.   The  text  below  provides  only a parameter summary. See post-
       conf(5) for more details including examples.

       alternate_config_directories (empty)
	      A list of non-default Postfix configuration directories that may
	      be  specified with "-c config_directory" on the command line, or
	      via the MAIL_CONFIG environment parameter.

       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)
	      The default location of the Postfix main.cf and  master.cf  con-
	      figuration files.

       command_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)
	      The location of all postfix administrative commands.

       fast_flush_domains ($relay_domains)
	      Optional list of destinations that are eligible for per-destina-
	      tion logfiles with mail that is queued to those destinations.

       import_environment (see 'postconf -d' output)
	      The list of environment parameters that a Postfix  process  will
	      import from a non-Postfix parent process.

       queue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)
	      The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.

       syslog_facility (mail)
	      The syslog facility of Postfix logging.

       syslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)
	      The  mail  system  name that is prepended to the process name in
	      syslog records, so that "smtpd"  becomes,  for  example,	"post-
	      fix/smtpd".

       trigger_timeout (10s)
	      The  time  limit	for sending a trigger to a Postfix daemon (for
	      example, the pickup(8) or qmgr(8) daemon).

       Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later:

       authorized_flush_users (static:anyone)
	      List of users who are authorized to flush the queue.

       authorized_mailq_users (static:anyone)
	      List of users who are authorized to view the queue.
