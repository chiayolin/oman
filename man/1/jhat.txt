NAME
       jhat - Java Heap Analysis Tool


SYNOPSIS
       jhat [ options ] <heap-dump-file>




PARAMETERS
       options
	  Options,  if used, should follow immediately after the command name.

       heap-dump-file
	  Java binary heap dump file to be browsed. For a dump file that  con-
	  tains multiple heap dumps, you may specify which dump in the file by
	  appending "#<number> to the file name, i.e. "foo.hprof#3".


DESCRIPTION
       The jhat command parses a java heap dump file and launches a webserver.
       jhat  enables  you to browse heap dumps using your favorite webbrowser.
       jhat supports pre-designed queries (such as 'show all  instances  of  a
       known class "Foo"') as well as OQL (Object Query Language) - a SQL-like
       query language to query heap dumps. Help on OQL is available  from  the
       OQL  help page shown by jhat. With the default port, OQL help is avail-
       able at http://localhost:7000/oqlhelp/


       There are several ways to generate a java heap dump:


	  * Use jmap -dump option to obtain a heap dump at runtime;

	  * Use jconsole option to obtain a heap dump via HotSpotDiagnos-
	    ticMXBean @
	    http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/jre/api/management/exten-
	    sion/com/sun/management/HotSpotDiagnosticsMXBean.html at runtime;

	  * Heap dump will be generated when OutOfMemoryError is thrown by
	    specifying -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError VM option;

	  * Use hprof @
	    http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Program-
	    ming/HPROF.html.



       NOTE: This tool is experimental and may not be available in future ver-
       sions of the JDK.


OPTIONS
       -stack false/true
	  Turn off tracking object allocation call stack. Note that if alloca-
	  tion site information is not available in the heap dump, you have to
	  set this flag to false. Default is true.

       -refs false/true
	  Turn off tracking of references to objects. Default is true. By
	  default, back pointers (objects pointing to a given object a.k.a
	  referrers or in-coming references) are calculated for all objects in
	  the heap.

       -port port-number
	  Set the port for the jhat's HTTP server. Default is 7000.

       -exclude exclude-file
	  Specify a file that lists data members that should be excluded from
	  the "reachable objects" query. For example, if the file lists
	  java.lang.String.value, then, whenever list of objects reachable
	  from a specific object "o" are calculated, reference paths involving
	  java.lang.String.value field will not considered.

       -baseline baseline-dump-file
	  Specify a baseline heap dump. Objects in both heap dumps with the
	  same object ID will be marked as not being "new". Other objects will
	  be marked as "new". This is useful while comparing two different
	  heap dumps.

       -debug int
	  Set debug level for this tool. 0 means no debug output. Set higher
	  values for more verbose modes.

       -version
	  Report version number and exit.

       -h
	  Output help message and exit.

       -help
	  Output help message and exit.

       -J<flag>
	  Pass <flag> to the Java virtual machine on which jhat is run. For
	  example, -J-Xmx512m to use a maximum heap size of 512MB.
