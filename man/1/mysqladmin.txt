NAME
       mysqladmin - client for administering a MySQL server

SYNOPSIS
       mysqladmin [options] command [command-options] [command
										      [command-options]]
										      ...

DESCRIPTION
       mysqladmin is a client for performing administrative operations. You
       can use it to check the server's configuration and current status, to
       create and drop databases, and more.

       Invoke mysqladmin like this:

	   shell> mysqladmin [options] command [command-arg] [command [command-arg]] ...

       mysqladmin supports the following commands. Some of the commands take
       an argument following the command name.

       o   create db_name

	   Create a new database named db_name.

       o   debug

	   Tell the server to write debug information to the error log. Format
	   and content of this information is subject to change.

	   This includes information about the Event Scheduler. See
	   Section 20.4.5, "Event Scheduler Status".

       o   drop db_name

	   Delete the database named db_name and all its tables.

       o   extended-status

	   Display the server status variables and their values.

       o   flush-hosts

	   Flush all information in the host cache.

       o   flush-logs

	   Flush all logs.

       o   flush-privileges

	   Reload the grant tables (same as reload).

       o   flush-status

	   Clear status variables.

       o   flush-tables

	   Flush all tables.

       o   flush-threads

	   Flush the thread cache.

       o   kill id,id,...

	   Kill server threads. If multiple thread ID values are given, there
	   must be no spaces in the list.

       o   old-password new-password

	   This is like the password command but stores the password using the
	   old (pre-4.1) password-hashing format. (See Section 6.1.2.4,
	   "Password Hashing in MySQL".)

       o   password new-password

	   Set a new password. This changes the password to new-password for
	   the account that you use with mysqladmin for connecting to the
	   server. Thus, the next time you invoke mysqladmin (or any other
	   client program) using the same account, you will need to specify
	   the new password.

	   If the new-password value contains spaces or other characters that
	   are special to your command interpreter, you need to enclose it
	   within quotation marks. On Windows, be sure to use double quotation
	   marks rather than single quotation marks; single quotation marks
	   are not stripped from the password, but rather are interpreted as
	   part of the password. For example:

	       shell> mysqladmin password "my new password"

	   In MySQL 5.6, the new password can be omitted following the
	   password command. In this case, mysqladmin prompts for the password
	   value, which enables you to avoid specifying the password on the
	   command line. Omitting the password value should be done only if
	   password is the final command on the mysqladmin command line.
	   Otherwise, the next argument is taken as the password.

	       Caution
	       Do not use this command used if the server was started with the
	       --skip-grant-tables option. No password change will be applied.
	       This is true even if you precede the password command with
	       flush-privileges on the same command line to re-enable the
	       grant tables because the flush operation occurs after you
	       connect. However, you can use mysqladmin flush-privileges to
	       re-enable the grant table and then use a separate mysqladmin
	       password command to change the password.

       o   ping

	   Check whether the server is available. The return status from
	   mysqladmin is 0 if the server is running, 1 if it is not. This is 0
	   even in case of an error such as Access denied, because this means
	   that the server is running but refused the connection, which is
	   different from the server not running.

       o   processlist

	   Show a list of active server threads. This is like the output of
	   the SHOW PROCESSLIST statement. If the --verbose option is given,
	   the output is like that of SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST. (See
	   Section 13.7.5.30, "SHOW PROCESSLIST Syntax".)

       o   reload

	   Reload the grant tables.

       o   refresh

	   Flush all tables and close and open log files.

       o   shutdown

	   Stop the server.

       o   start-slave

	   Start replication on a slave server.

       o   status

	   Display a short server status message.

       o   stop-slave

	   Stop replication on a slave server.

       o   variables

	   Display the server system variables and their values.

       o   version

	   Display version information from the server.

       All commands can be shortened to any unique prefix. For example:

	   shell> mysqladmin proc stat
	   +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
	   | Id | User	| Host	    | db | Command | Time | State | Info	     |
	   +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
	   | 51 | monty | localhost |	 | Query   | 0	  |	  | show processlist |
	   +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
	   Uptime: 1473624  Threads: 1	Questions: 39487
	   Slow queries: 0  Opens: 541	Flush tables: 1
	   Open tables: 19  Queries per second avg: 0.0268


       The mysqladmin status command result displays the following values:

       o   Uptime

	   The number of seconds the MySQL server has been running.

       o   Threads

	   The number of active threads (clients).

       o   Questions

	   The number of questions (queries) from clients since the server was
	   started.

       o   Slow queries

	   The number of queries that have taken more than long_query_time
	   seconds. See Section 5.2.5, "The Slow Query Log".

       o   Opens

	   The number of tables the server has opened.

       o   Flush tables

	   The number of flush-*, refresh, and reload commands the server has
	   executed.

       o   Open tables

	   The number of tables that currently are open.

       If you execute mysqladmin shutdown when connecting to a local server
       using a Unix socket file, mysqladmin waits until the server's process
       ID file has been removed, to ensure that the server has stopped
       properly.

       mysqladmin supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysqladmin] and [client] groups of an
       option file. For information about option files used by MySQL programs,
       see Section 4.2.6, "Using Option Files".

       o   --help, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --bind-address=ip_address

	   On a computer having multiple network interfaces, use this option
	   to select which interface to use for connecting to the MySQL
	   server.

	   This option is supported beginning with MySQL 5.6.1.

       o   --character-sets-dir=path

	   The directory where character sets are installed. See Section 10.5,
	   "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --compress, -C

	   Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
	   both support compression.

       o   --count=N, -c N

	   The number of iterations to make for repeated command execution if
	   the --sleep option is given.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

	   Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
	   d:t:o,file_name. The default is d:t:o,/tmp/mysqladmin.trace.

       o   --debug-check

	   Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       o   --debug-info

	   Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics
	   when the program exits.

       o   --default-auth=plugin

	   A hint about the client-side authentication plugin to use. See
	   Section 6.3.7, "Pluggable Authentication".

       o   --default-character-set=charset_name

	   Use charset_name as the default character set. See Section 10.5,
	   "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --defaults-extra-file=file_name

	   Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix)
	   before the user option file. If the file does not exist or is
	   otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
	   relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
	   rather than a full path name.

       o   --defaults-file=file_name

	   Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is
	   otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
	   relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
	   rather than a full path name.

       o   --defaults-group-suffix=str

	   Read not only the usual option groups, but also groups with the
	   usual names and a suffix of str. For example, mysqladmin normally
	   reads the [client] and [mysqladmin] groups. If the
	   --defaults-group-suffix=_other option is given, mysqladmin also
	   reads the [client_other] and [mysqladmin_other] groups.

       o   --enable-cleartext-plugin

	   Enable the mysql_clear_password cleartext authentication plugin.
	   (See Section 6.3.8.7, "The Cleartext Client-Side Authentication
	   Plugin".) This option was added in MySQL 5.6.7.

       o   --force, -f

	   Do not ask for confirmation for the drop db_name command. With
	   multiple commands, continue even if an error occurs.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

	   Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o   --login-path=name

	   Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login
	   path file. A "login path" is an option group that permits only a
	   limited set of options: host, user, and password. Think of a login
	   path as a set of values that indicate the server host and the
	   credentials for authenticating with the server. To create the login
	   path file, use the mysql_config_editor utility. See
	   mysql_config_editor(1). This option was added in MySQL 5.6.6.

       o   --no-beep, -b

	   Suppress the warning beep that is emitted by default for errors
	   such as a failure to connect to the server.

       o   --no-defaults

	   Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to
	   reading unknown options from an option file, --no-defaults can be
	   used to prevent them from being read.

	   The exception is that the .mylogin.cnf file, if it exists, is read
	   in all cases. This permits passwords to be specified in a safer way
	   than on the command line even when --no-defaults is used.
	   (.mylogin.cnf is created by the mysql_config_editor utility. See
	   mysql_config_editor(1).)

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

	   The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
	   short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
	   and the password. If you omit the password value following the
	   --password or -p option on the command line, mysqladmin prompts for
	   one.

	   Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
	   insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
	   Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
	   on the command line.

       o   --pipe, -W

	   On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe. This option
	   applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

       o   --plugin-dir=path

	   The directory in which to look for plugins. It may be necessary to
	   specify this option if the --default-auth option is used to specify
	   an authentication plugin but mysqladmin does not find it. See
	   Section 6.3.7, "Pluggable Authentication".

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

	   The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o   --print-defaults

	   Print the program name and all options that it gets from option
	   files.

       o   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

	   The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
	   useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
	   protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the
	   permissible values, see Section 4.2.2, "Connecting to the MySQL
	   Server".

       o   --relative, -r

	   Show the difference between the current and previous values when
	   used with the --sleep option. This option works only with the
	   extended-status command.

       o   --secure-auth

	   Do not send passwords to the server in old (pre-4.1) format. This
	   prevents connections except for servers that use the newer password
	   format. This option is enabled by default; use --skip-secure-auth
	   to disable it. This option was added in MySQL 5.6.17.

	       Note
	       Passwords that use the pre-4.1 hashing method are less secure
	       than passwords that use the native password hashing method and
	       should be avoided. Pre-4.1 passwords are deprecated and support
	       for them will be removed in a future MySQL release. For account
	       upgrade instructions, see Section 6.3.8.3, "Migrating Away from
	       Pre-4.1 Password Hashing and the mysql_old_password Plugin".

       o   --shared-memory-base-name=name

	   On Windows, the shared-memory name to use, for connections made
	   using shared memory to a local server. The default value is MYSQL.
	   The shared-memory name is case sensitive.

	   The server must be started with the --shared-memory option to
	   enable shared-memory connections.

       o   --silent, -s

	   Exit silently if a connection to the server cannot be established.

       o   --sleep=delay, -i delay

	   Execute commands repeatedly, sleeping for delay seconds in between.
	   The --count option determines the number of iterations. If --count
	   is not given, mysqladmin executes commands indefinitely until
	   interrupted.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

	   For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
	   Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       o   --ssl*

	   Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the
	   server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and
	   certificates. See Section 6.3.10.4, "SSL Command Options".

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

	   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --verbose, -v

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       o   --version, -V

	   Display version information and exit.

       o   --vertical, -E

	   Print output vertically. This is similar to --relative, but prints
	   output vertically.

       o   --wait[=count], -w[count]

	   If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry instead of
	   aborting. If a count value is given, it indicates the number of
	   times to retry. The default is one time.

       You can also set the following variables by using --var_name=value.

       o   connect_timeout

	   The maximum number of seconds before connection timeout. The
	   default value is 43200 (12 hours).

       o   shutdown_timeout

	   The maximum number of seconds to wait for server shutdown. The
	   default value is 3600 (1 hour).
