NAME
       lipo - create or operate on universal files

SYNOPSIS
       lipo  [-info]  [-detailed_info]	[-arch	arch_type  input_file]	...  [
       input_file] ...	[-arch_blank arch_type]  [-create]  [-thin  arch_type]
       [-replace  arch_type  filename] ...  [-remove arch_type] ...  [-extract
       arch_type]  ...	  [-extract_family   arch_type]   ...	 [-verify_arch
       arch_type ...]  [-output output_file] [-segalign arch_type value] ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  lipo command creates or operates on ``universal'' (multi-architec-
       ture) files.  It only ever produces one output file, and  never	alters
       the  input  file.   The	operations that lipo performs are: listing the
       architecture types in a universal file;	creating  a  single  universal
       file from one or more input files; thinning out a single universal file
       to one specified architecture type; and extracting,  replacing,	and/or
       removing architectures types from the input file to create a single new
       universal output file.

       Only one  option  can  be  specified,  with  the  exception  of	-arch,
       -arch_blank, -output, and -segalign, which are used in combination with
       other options.  The input_file argument is required, and only the -cre-
       ate  option allows more than one input_file to be specified.  The -out-
       put flag must be used, except with the -info and -detailed_info	flags.

       The  arch_type arguments may be any of the supported architecture names
       listed in the man page arch(3).

OPTIONS
       -info  Briefly list the architecture types in the input universal  file
	      (just the names of each architecture).

       -detailed_info
	      Display  a  detailed list of the architecture types in the input
	      universal file (all the the information in the universal header,
	      for each architecture in the file).

       -arch arch_type input_file
	      Tells  lipo  that input_file contains the specified architecture
	      type.  The  -arch  arch_type  specification  is  unnecessary  if
	      input_file  is  an  object file, a universal file, or some other
	      file whose architecture(s) lipo can figure out.

       -arch_blank arch_type
	      Specifies that the output for the specified arch_type will be an
	      MH_DYLIB_STUB file. This flag may not be used with any operation
	      other than -create.

       -output output_file
	      Specifies its argument to be the output file.

       -create
	      Take the input files (or file) and create one  universal	output
	      file from them.

       -thin arch_type
	      Take one input file and create a thin output file with the spec-
	      ified arch_type.

       -replace arch_type file_name
	      Take one universal input file; in the output file,  replace  the
	      arch_type  contents  of  the input file with the contents of the
	      specified file_name.

       -remove arch_type
	      Take one universal input file and remove the arch_type from that
	      universal file, placing the result in the output file.

       -extract arch_type
	      Take  one  universal input file and copy the arch_type from that
	      universal file into a universal output file containing only that
	      architecture.

       -extract_family arch_type
	      Take one universal input file and copy all of the arch_types for
	      the family that arch_type is in from that universal file into an
	      output  file containing only those architectures.  The file will
	      be thin if only one architecture is found  or  universal	other-
	      wise.

       -verify_arch arch_type ...
	      Take  one  input	file  and  verify the specified arch_types are
	      present in the file.  If so then exit with a status  of  0  else
	      exit with a status of 1.

       -segalign arch_type value
	      Set the segment alignment of the specified arch_type when creat-
	      ing a universal file containing that architecture.  value  is  a
	      hexadecimal number that must be an integral power of 2.  This is
	      only needed when lipo can't figure out the alignment of an input
	      file  (currently	not an object file), or when it guesses at the
	      alignment too conservatively.  The default for files unknown  to
	      lipo  is	0  (2^0, or an alignment of one byte), and the default
	      alignment for archives is 4 (2^2, or 4-byte alignment).
