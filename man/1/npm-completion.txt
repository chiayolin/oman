NAME
       npm-completion - Tab Completion for npm

SYNOPSIS
	 . <(npm completion)

DESCRIPTION
       Enables tab-completion in all npm commands.

       The  synopsis  above  loads  the  completions  into your current shell.
       Adding it to your ~/.bashrc  or	~/.zshrc  will	make  the  completions
       available everywhere.

       You may of course also pipe the output of npm completion to a file such
       as /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/npm if you have a system that  will
       read that file for you.

       When  COMP_CWORD, COMP_LINE, and COMP_POINT are defined in the environ-
       ment, npm completion acts in "plumbing mode", and  outputs  completions
       based on the arguments.
