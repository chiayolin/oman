NAME
       since - display content of a file since the last time

SYNOPSIS
       since [-aefhlmnqvxz] [-d seconds] [-s file] files


DESCRIPTION
       since  is a utility designed to monitor log files.  since is similar to
       tail(2) as it also displays information appended to  a  file.   However
       since  only  displays the data which has been added since the last time
       since was run. If since is run on a particular file for the first time,
       then the entire file is displayed.

EXAMPLE
       since /var/log/apache/{access,error}_log > /dev/null
       lynx --dump http://localhost/ > /dev/null
       since /var/log/apache/{access,error}_log


OPTIONS
       -a     Make  updates  to the since state files atomic. This option con-
	      figures since to use a temporary file and a rename(2) instead of
	      updating the state file in situ.


       -d seconds
	      Specify  the  number  of integer seconds to wait between polling
	      files for changes. This option is only relevant  in  conjunction
	      with  the  -f  option  and if the inotify mechanism is not being
	      used.


       -e     Print the header lines to standard  error  instead  of  standard
	      output.


       -f     Follow  the specified files. This option is analogous to tail -f
	      as the files are also polled for changes until  the  process  is
	      interrupted.


       -h     Print a terse help message.


       -l     Relaxed mode. If some data files are inaccessible since will not
	      fail completely.


       -m     Disable mmap(2), use read(2) instead to access  state  and  data
	      files.   Note that for certain smaller io operations read(2) may
	      be used even if this option has not been given.


       -n     Do not update the .since file which keeps track of file  growth.


       -q     Make the utility operate more quietly.


       -s filename
	      Specify  the  state file explicitly. Using this option will also
	      disable the use of fallback state files.


       -v     Increase the verbosity. This option can be given multiple times.


       -x     Ignore file arguments which have compressed extensions.


       -z     Discard  output. Similar to redirecting the output to /dev/null,
	      but faster. If used in conjunction with the -f option, only  the
	      initial output will be discarded.


FILES
       .since

	      State  file  recording  the  length  of the previously displayed
	      files.  The location of the file can be set on the command  line
	      using  the  -s  option.  If this option is not given, since will
	      check the SINCE environment variable for	the  location  of  the
	      state  file.  If the SINCE environment variable has not been set
	      since will use the  HOME	environment  variable  and  store  the
	      information  in  the file $HOME/.since.  If the HOME variable is
	      not set, since will use a getpwuid(3) lookup. If all these  fail
	      will use the file /tmp/since.


BUGS
       since  uses  the  inode of a file as its key, if that inode is recycled
       since will get confused.  since	is  not  particularly  efficient  when
       storing or looking up the stat(2) information. Functionality equivalent
       to since can probably be  achieved  with  a  number  of	trivial  shell
       scripts.


COPYING
       since may only be used, distributed and modified in accordance with the
       terms of the GPL (GNU General Public License) version  3  or  newer  as
       published by the FSF (Free Software Foundation).
