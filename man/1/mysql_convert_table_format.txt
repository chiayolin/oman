MYSQL_CONVERT_TAB(1)	     MySQL Database System	  MYSQL_CONVERT_TAB(1)



NAME
       mysql_convert_table_format - convert tables to use a given storage
       engine

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_convert_table_format [options] db_name

DESCRIPTION
	   Note
	   This utility is deprecated in MySQL 5.6.17 and removed in MySQL 5.7

       mysql_convert_table_format converts the tables in a database to use a
       particular storage engine (MyISAM by default).
       mysql_convert_table_format is written in Perl and requires that the DBI
       and DBD::mysql Perl modules be installed (see Section 2.13, "Perl
       Installation Notes").

       Invoke mysql_convert_table_format like this:

	   shell> mysql_convert_table_format [options]db_name

       The db_name argument indicates the database containing the tables to be
       converted.

       mysql_convert_table_format supports the options described in the
       following list.

       o   --help

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --force

	   Continue even if errors occur.

       o   --host=host_name

	   Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o   --password=password

	   The password to use when connecting to the server. Note that the
	   password value is not optional for this option, unlike for other
	   MySQL programs.

	   Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
	   insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
	   Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
	   on the command line.

       o   --port=port_num

	   The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o   --socket=path

	   For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use.

       o   --type=engine_name

	   Specify the storage engine that the tables should be converted to
	   use. The default is MyISAM if this option is not given.

       o   --user=user_name

	   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --verbose

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       o   --version

	   Display version information and exit.
