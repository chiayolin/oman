NAME
       M4 - macro processor

SYNOPSIS
       m4 [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Process	macros in FILEs.  If no FILE or if FILE is `-', standard input
       is read.

       Mandatory or optional  arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  or
       optional for short options too.

   Operation modes:
       --help display this help and exit

       --version
	      output version information and exit

       -E, --fatal-warnings
	      stop execution after first warning

       -e, --interactive
	      unbuffer output, ignore interrupts

       -P, --prefix-builtins
	      force a `m4_' prefix to all builtins

       -Q, --quiet, --silent
	      suppress some warnings for builtins

   Preprocessor features:
       -D, --define=NAME[=VALUE]
	      define NAME has having VALUE, or empty

       -I, --include=DIRECTORY
	      append DIRECTORY to include path

       -s, --synclines
	      generate `#line NUM "FILE"' lines

       -U, --undefine=NAME
	      undefine NAME

   Limits control:
       -G, --traditional
	      suppress all GNU extensions

       -H, --hashsize=PRIME
	      set symbol lookup hash table size [509]

       -L, --nesting-limit=NUMBER
	      change artificial nesting limit [1024]

   Frozen state files:
       -F, --freeze-state=FILE
	      produce a frozen state on FILE at end

       -R, --reload-state=FILE
	      reload a frozen state from FILE at start

   Debugging:
       -d, --debug[=FLAGS]
	      set debug level (no FLAGS implies `aeq')

       -l, --arglength=NUM
	      restrict macro tracing size

       -o, --error-output=FILE
	      redirect debug and trace output

       -t, --trace=NAME
	      trace NAME when it will be defined

   FLAGS is any of:
       a      show actual arguments

       c      show before collect, after collect and after call

       e      show expansion

       f      say current input file name

       i      show changes in input files

       l      say current input line number

       p      show results of path searches

       q      quote values as necessary, with a or e flag

       t      trace for all macro calls, not only traceon'ed

       x      add a unique macro call id, useful with c flag

       V      shorthand for all of the above flags

       If defined, the environment variable `M4PATH' is a colon-separated list
       of directories included after any specified by `-I'.

       Exit status is 0 for success, 1 for failure, 63 for frozen file version
       mismatch, or whatever value was passed to the m4exit macro.
