NAME
       sane-find-scanner - find SCSI and USB scanners and their device files

SYNOPSIS
       sane-find-scanner [-h|-?]  [-v] [-q] [-p] [-f] [-F filename] [devname]


DESCRIPTION
       sane-find-scanner  is a command-line tool to find SCSI and USB scanners
       and determine their Unix device files. Its primary aim is to make  sure
       that scanners can be detected by SANE backends.

       For  SCSI  scanners,  it  checks  the default generic SCSI device files
       (e.g., /dev/sg0) and /dev/scanner.  The test is done by sending a  SCSI
       inquiry	command and looking for a device type of "scanner" or "proces-
       sor"  (some  old  HP   scanners	 seem	to   send   "processor").   So
       sane-find-scanner will find any SCSI scanner connected to those default
       device files even if it isn't supported by any SANE backend.

       For USB scanners, first the  USB  kernel  scanner  device  files  (e.g.
       /dev/usb/scanner0),  /dev/usb/scanner, and /dev/usbscanner) are tested.
       The files are opened and the vendor and device ids are  determined,  if
       the  operating system supports this feature. Currently USB scanners are
       only found this way if they are supported by the Linux  scanner	module
       or   the   FreeBSD   or	OpenBSD  uscanner  driver.  After  that  test,
       sane-find-scanner tries to scan	for  USB  devices  found  by  the  USB
       library	libusb (if available). There is no special USB class for scan-
       ners, so the heuristics used to distinguish  scanners  from  other  USB
       devices	is  not perfect.  sane-find-scanner also tries to find out the
       type of USB chip used in the scanner. If detected, it will  be  printed
       after the vendor and product ids.  sane-find-scanner will even find USB
       scanners, that are not supported by any SANE backend.

       sane-find-scanner won't find most parallel port scanners,  or  scanners
       connected  to  proprietary  ports.  Some  parallel port scanners may be
       detected by sane-find-scanner -p.  At the time  of  writing  this  will
       only detect Mustek parallel port scanners.


OPTIONS
       -h, -?  Prints a short usage message.

       -v      Verbose	output.  If  used  once, sane-find-scanner shows every
	       device name and the test result.  If used twice,  SCSI  inquiry
	       information and the USB device descriptors are also printed.

       -q      Be quiet. Print only the devices, no comments.

       -p      Probe parallel port scanners.

       -f      Force  opening  all  explicitly	given  devices as SCSI and USB
	       devices. That's useful if sane-find-scanner is wrong in	deter-
	       mining the device type.

       -F filename
	       filename  is a file that contains USB descriptors in the format
	       of /proc/bus/usb/devices as used by  Linux.   sane-find-scanner
	       tries  to  identify the chipset(s) of all USB scanners found in
	       such a file. This option is useful for developers when the out-
	       put of "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices" is available but the scanner
	       itself isn't.

       devname Test device file "devname". No other  devices  are  checked  if
	       devname is given.

EXAMPLE
       sane-find-scanner -v
       Check  all SCSI and USB devices for available scanners and print a line
       for every device file.

       sane-find-scanner /dev/scanner
       Look for a (SCSI) scanner only at /dev/scanner and print the result.

       sane-find-scanner -p
       Probe for parallel port scanners.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
       USB  support  is  limited  to  Linux (kernel, libusb), FreeBSD (kernel,
       libusb), NetBSD (libusb), OpenBSD (kernel, libusb). Detecting the  ven-
       dor and device ids only works with Linux or libusb.

       SCSI  support  is  available  on  Irix, EMX, Linux, Next, AIX, Solaris,
       FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and HP-UX.


BUGS
       No support for most parallel port scanners yet.
       Detection of USB chipsets is limited to a few chipsets.
