DESCRIPTION
       sane-config is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and linker
       flags  that should be used to compile and link SANE frontends to a SANE
       backend library (libsane).

       sane-config accepts the following options (you can't use more than  one
       option at the same time):

       --version
	       Print  the  currently installed version of libsane on the stan-
	       dard output.

       --help OPTION
	       Print a short usage message. If OPTION is specified,  help  for
	       that option (e.g. --libs) is printed (if available).

       --libs  Print  the  additional  libraries  that are necessary to link a
	       SANE frontend to libsane.

       --ldflags
	       Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a SANE  fron-
	       tend to libsane.

       --cflags
	       Print  the  compiler flags that are necessary to compile a SANE
	       frontend.

       --prefix
