NAME
     ncdestroy -- Destroy kernel NFS credentials

SYNOPSIS
     ncdestroy [-v] [-P] [path [path...]]

DESCRIPTION
     ncdestroy invalidates the caller's kernel GSS credentials for any of the
     specified path's associated NFS mounts.  If no paths are specified then
     all the caller's associated credentials for all NFS file systems are
     destroyed.

     When a nfs file system is mounted using a GSS mechanism (currently only
     Kerberos is supported) through the ``sec='' option or by the export spec-
     ified on the server, the resulting session context is stored in a table
     for each mount. If the user decides to finish his or her session or
     chooses to use a different credential, then ncdestroy can be called to
     invalidate those credentials in the kernel. New credentials can be obtain
     (typically by calling kinit) and those credentials can be used when
     accessing the mount.

     The options are as follows:

     -v      Be verbose and show what file system is being operated on and any
	     resulting errors.

     -P      If the trailing component resolves to a symbolic link do not
	     resolve the link but use the current path to determine any asso-
	     ciate NFS file system.

EXAMPLES
     If leaving for the day:

      $ kdestroy -A
      $ ncdestroy

     Lets say a user does

      $ kinit user@FOO.COM

     And through the automounter access a path /Network/Serves/some-
     server/Sources/foo/bar where the mount of /Network/Servers/some-
     server/Sources/foo was done with user@FOO.COM.

      $ cat /Network/Servers/someserver/Sources/foo/bar
      cat: /Network/Servers/someserver/Sources/foo/bar: Permission denied

     The user realizes that in order to have access on the server his identity
     should be user2@BAR.COM. So:

      $ kdestroy -A
      $ kinit user2@BAR.COM
      $ ncdestroy /Network/Servers/someserver/Sources/foo

     Now the local user can access bar

NOTES
     In the above example the user destroyed all credentials so the only cre-
     dential to choose was new credential user2@BAR.COM. However, if accessing
     the server with user@FOO.COM was done by getting a cross realm TGT to
     obtain the service ticket nfs/some.server.fqdn@BAR.COM, then it won't be
     necessary to use kdestroy. The GSS infrastructure will prefer to use cre-
     dentials in the same realm as the service.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The ncdestroy command will exit with 1 if any of the supplied paths don't
     exist. If all paths exist or no paths are given the exit status will be
     0.

BUGS
     There should be an option to kdestroy to destroy cached nfs contexts.
