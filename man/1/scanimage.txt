DESCRIPTION
       scanimage  is  a  command-line  interface  to control image acquisition
       devices such as flatbed scanners or cameras.  The device is  controlled
       via  command-line  options.   After  command-line processing, scanimage
       normally proceeds to acquire an image.  The image data  is  written  to
       standard  output  in  one of the PNM (portable aNyMaP) formats (PBM for
       black-and-white images, PGM for grayscale images,  and  PPM  for  color
       images)	or  in	TIFF (black-and-white, grayscale or color).  scanimage
       accesses image acquisition devices through the SANE (Scanner Access Now
       Easy)  interface and can thus support any device for which there exists
       a SANE backend (try apropos sane- to get a list of available backends).


EXAMPLES
       To get a list of devices:

	 scanimage -L

       To scan with default settings to the file image.pnm:

	 scanimage >image.pnm

       To  scan 100x100 mm to the file image.tiff (-x and -y may not be avail-
       able with all devices):

	 scanimage -x 100 -y 100 --format=tiff >image.tiff

       To print all available options:

	 scanimage -h


OPTIONS
       Parameters are separated by a blank from single-character options (e.g.
       -d   epson)   and   by	a   "="  from  multi-character	options  (e.g.
       --device-name=epson).


       The -d or --device-name options must be followed by a SANE  device-name
       like  `epson:/dev/sg0'  or  `hp:/dev/usbscanner0'.  A (partial) list of
       available devices can be obtained with the --list-devices  option  (see
       below).	 If  no device-name is specified explicitly, scanimage reads a
       device-name from the environment variable SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE.  If this
       variable is not set, scanimage will attempt to open the first available
       device.

       The --format format option selects how image data is written  to  stan-
       dard  output.  format can be pnm or tiff.  If --format is not used, PNM
       is written.

       The -i or --icc-profile option is used to include an ICC profile into a
       TIFF file.

       The  -L	or  --list-devices option requests a (partial) list of devices
       that are available.  The list is not complete since some devices may be
       available,  but are not listed in any of the configuration files (which
       are  typically	stored	 in   directory   /usr/local/Cellar/sane-back-
       ends/1.0.24_1/etc/sane.d).   This is particularly the case when access-
       ing scanners through the network.  If a device is not listed in a  con-
       figuration  file, the only way to access it is by its full device name.
       You may need to consult your system administrator to find out the names
       of such devices.

       The   -f   or   --formatted-device-list	 option   works   similar   to
       --list-devices, but requires a format string.  scanimage  replaces  the
       placeholders %d %v %m %t %i %n with the device name, vendor name, model
       name, scanner type, an index number and newline respectively. The  com-
       mand

	      scanimage  -f  "	scanner number %i device %d is a %t, model %m,
	      produced by %v "

       will produce something like:

	      scanner number 0	device sharp:/dev/sg1 is  a  flatbed  scanner,
	      model JX250 SCSI, produced by SHARP

       The  --batch* options provide the features for scanning documents using
       document feeders.  --batch [format] is used to specify  the  format  of
       the  filename  that each page will be written to.  Each page is written
       out to a single file.  If format  is  not  specified,  the  default  of
       out%d.pnm  (or  out%d.tif  for  --format tiff) will be used.  format is
       given  as  a  printf  style  string   with   one   integer   parameter.
       --batch-start start selects the page number to start naming files with.
       If  this  option  is  not  given,  the  counter	will   start   at   1.
       --batch-count  count  specifies the number of pages to attempt to scan.
       If not given,  scanimage  will  continue  scanning  until  the  scanner
       returns	a state other than OK.	Not all scanners with document feeders
       signal when the ADF is empty, use this command  to  work  around  them.
       With  --batch-increment	increment  you	can change the amount that the
       number in the filename is incremented by.  Generally this is used  when
       you  are  scanning  double-sided  documents  on a single-sided document
       feeder.	A specific command is provided	to  aid  this:	--batch-double
       will automatically set the increment to 2.  --batch-prompt will ask for
       pressing RETURN before scanning a page. This can be used  for  scanning
       multiple pages without an automatic document feeder.

       The  --accept-md5-only  option only accepts user authorization requests
       that support MD5 security. The SANE network daemon (saned)  is  capable
       of doing such requests. See saned(8).

       The  -p	or --progress option requests that scanimage prints a progress
       counter. It shows how much image data of the current image has  already
       been received by scanimage (in percent).

       The  -n	or  --dont-scan  option  requests that scanimage only sets the
       options provided by the user but doesn't actually perform a scan.  This
       option can be used to e.g. turn off the scanner's lamp (if supported by
       the backend).

       The -T or --test option requests that scanimage performs a  few	simple
       sanity  tests to make sure the backend works as defined by the SANE API
       (in particular the sane_read function is exercised by this test).

       The -A or --all-options option requests that scanimage lists all avail-
       able options exposed the backend, including button options.  The infor-
       mation is printed on standard output and no scan will be done.

       The -h or --help options request help information.  The information  is
       printed on standard output and in this case, no attempt will be made to
       acquire an image.

       The -v or --verbose options increase the verbosity of the operation  of
       scanimage.   The option may be specified repeatedly, each time increas-
       ing the verbosity level.

       The -B or --buffer-size changes the input buffer size from 32KB to  the
       number kB specified or 1M.

       The  -V	or --version option requests that scanimage prints the program
       and package name, the version number of the SANE distribution  that  it
       came  with and the version of the backend that it loads. Usually that's
       the dll backend. If more information about the version numbers  of  the
       backends  are  necessary, the DEBUG variable for the dll backend can be
       used. Example: SANE_DEBUG_DLL=3 scanimage -L.

       As you might imagine, much of the power of  scanimage  comes  from  the
       fact that it can control any SANE backend.  Thus, the exact set of com-
       mand-line options depends on the capabilities of the  selected  device.
       To  see the options for a device named dev, invoke scanimage via a com-
       mand-line of the form:

	      scanimage --help --device-name dev

       The documentation for the device-specific options printed by --help  is
       best explained with a few examples:

	-l 0..218mm [0]
	   Top-left x position of scan area.

	      The  description	above  shows  that option -l expects an option
	      value in the range from 0 to 218 mm.  The value in square brack-
	      ets  indicates that the current option value is 0 mm. Most back-
	      ends provide similar geometry options for  top-left  y  position
	      (-t), width (-x) and height of scan-area (-y).


	--brightness -100..100% [0]
	   Controls the brightness of the acquired image.

	      The  description above shows that option --brightness expects an
	      option value in the range from -100 to 100 percent.   The  value
	      in  square brackets indicates that the current option value is 0
	      percent.

	--default-enhancements
	   Set default values for enhancement controls.

	      The description above shows that	option	--default-enhancements
	      has no option value.  It should be thought of as having an imme-
	      diate effect at the  point  of  the  command-line  at  which  it
	      appears.	For example, since this option resets the --brightness
	      option, the option-pair --brightness  50	--default-enhancements
	      would effectively be a no-op.

	--mode Lineart|Gray|Color [Gray]
	   Selects the scan mode (e.g., lineart or color).

	      The  description above shows that option --mode accepts an argu-
	      ment that must be one of the strings Lineart,  Gray,  or	Color.
	      The  value  in  the  square bracket indicates that the option is
	      currently set to Gray.  For convenience, it is legal to abbrevi-
	      ate  the string values as long as they remain unique.  Also, the
	      case of the spelling doesn't matter.  For example,  option  set-
	      ting --mode col is identical to --mode Color.

	--custom-gamma[=(yes|no)] [inactive]
	   Determines whether a builtin or a custom gamma-table
	   should be used.

	      The  description	above shows that option --custom-gamma expects
	      either no option value, a "yes" string, or a "no" string.  Spec-
	      ifying  the  option  with  no  value is equivalent to specifying
	      "yes".  The value in square-brackets indicates that  the	option
	      is  not currently active.  That is, attempting to set the option
	      would result in an error message.  The set of available  options
	      typically  depends  on the settings of other options.  For exam-
	      ple, the --custom-gamma  table  might  be  active  only  when  a
	      grayscale or color scan-mode has been requested.

	      Note  that  the  --help option is processed only after all other
	      options have been processed.  This makes it possible to see  the
	      option  settings	for a particular mode by specifying the appro-
	      priate mode-options along with the --help option.  For  example,
	      the command-line:

	      scanimage --help --mode color

	      would  print  the  option  settings  that are in effect when the
	      color-mode is selected.

	--gamma-table 0..255,...
	   Gamma-correction table.  In color mode this option
	   equally affects the red, green, and blue channels
	   simultaneously (i.e., it is an intensity gamma table).

	      The description above shows that	option	--gamma-table  expects
	      zero or more values in the range 0 to 255.  For example, a legal
	      value for this option would be "3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12".	 Since
	      it's  cumbersome	to specify long vectors in this form, the same
	      can be expressed by the  abbreviated  form  "[0]3-[9]12".   What
	      this  means  is  that  the first vector element is set to 3, the
	      9-th element is set to 12 and the values in between are interpo-
	      lated  linearly.	 Of course, it is possible to specify multiple
	      such linear segments.  For example,  "[0]3-[2]3-[6]7,[7]10-[9]6"
	      is    equivalent	 to   "3,3,3,4,5,6,7,10,8,6".	 The   program
	      gamma4scanimage can be used to generate such gamma  tables  (see
	      gamma4scanimage(1) for details).

	--filename <string> [/tmp/input.ppm]
	   The filename of the image to be loaded.

	      The  description	above is an example of an option that takes an
	      arbitrary string value (which happens to be a filename).	Again,
	      the value in brackets show that the option is current set to the
	      filename /tmp/input.ppm.


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE
	      The default device-name.

FILES
       /usr/local/Cellar/sane-backends/1.0.24_1/etc/sane.d
	      This directory holds various configuration files.  For  details,

       ~/.sane/pass
	      This file contains lines of the form

	      user:password:resource

	      scanimage  uses  this  information  to answer user authorization
	      requests automatically. The file must have 0600  permissions  or
	      stricter.  You  should  use  this  file  in conjunction with the
	      --accept-md5-only  option  to  avoid  server-side  attacks.  The
	      resource may contain any character but is limited to 127 charac-
	      ters.
