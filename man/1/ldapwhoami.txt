       ldapwhoami  [-n] [-v] [-z] [-d debuglevel] [-D binddn] [-W] [-w passwd]
       [-y passwdfile]	    [-H ldapuri]      [-h ldaphost]	 [-p ldapport]

DESCRIPTION
       ldapwhoami implements the LDAP "Who Am I?" extended operation.

       ldapwhoami opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and performs  a
       whoami operation.

OPTIONS
       -n     Show  what  would be done, but don't actually perform the whoami
	      operation.  Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written  to  standard
	      output.

       -d debuglevel
	      Set  the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapwhoami must be
	      compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this  option  to  have  any
	      effect.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D binddn
	      Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
	      For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of spec-
	      ifying the password on the command line.

       -w passwd
	      Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y passwdfile
	      Use  complete  contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
	      authentication.

       -H ldapuri
	      Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the	proto-
	      col/host/port  fields  are  allowed; a list of URI, separated by
	      whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h ldaphost
	      Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server  is  running.
	      Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p ldapport
	      Specify  an  alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listen-
	      ing.  Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -O security-properties
	      Specify SASL security properties.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

	      Specify general extensions with -e and  search  extensions  with
	      -E.  '!' indicates criticality.

	      General extensions:
		[!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
		[!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
		[!]manageDSAit
		[!]noop
		ppolicy
		[!]postread[=<attrs>]	     (a comma-separated attribute list)
		[!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
		abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

	      Search extensions:
		[!]domainScope				     (domain scope)
		[!]mv=<filter>				     (matched values filter)
		[!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]	     (paged results/prompt)
		[!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
		[!]subentries[=true|false]	     (subentries)
		[!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]			     (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
			rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -I     Enable  SASL  Interactive  mode.	 Always prompt.  Default is to
	      prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U authcid
	      Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the  ID
	      depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R realm
	      Specify  the  realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form
	      of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X authzid
	      Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL  bind.   authzid
	      must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
	      u:<username>

       -Y mech
	      Specify the SASL mechanism to be	used  for  authentication.  If
	      it's  not  specified, the program will choose the best mechanism
	      the server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
	      you  use	-ZZ, the command will require the operation to be suc-
	      cessful.

EXAMPLE
	   ldapwhoami -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" -W
