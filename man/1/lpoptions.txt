SYNOPSIS
       lpoptions  [  -E  ]  [  -U  username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -d destina-
       tion[/instance] [ -l ]
       lpoptions [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port]  ]  [  -p  destina-
       tion[/instance] ] -o option[=value] ...
       lpoptions  [  -E  ]  [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -p destina-
       tion[/instance] ] -r option
       lpoptions [ -E ] [ -U username ]  [  -h	server[:port]  ]  -x  destina-
       tion[/instance]

DESCRIPTION
       lpoptions displays or sets printer options and defaults.  If no printer
       is specified using the -p  option,  the	default  printer  is  used  as
       described in lp(1).

       If  no  -l,  -o,  or  -r options are specified, the current options are
       reported on the standard output.

       Options set with the lpoptions command are used by the lp(1) and lpr(1)
       commands when submitting jobs.

       When  run by the root user, lpoptions gets and sets default options and
       instances for all users in the  /etc/cups/lpoptions  file.   Otherwise,
       the per-user defaults are managed in the ~/.cups/lpoptions file.

OPTIONS
       lpoptions supports the following options:

       -E   Enables encryption when communicating with the CUPS server.

       -U username
	    Uses an alternate username.

       -d destination[/instance]
	    Sets the user default printer to destination.  If instance is sup-
	    plied then that particular instance is used.   This  option  over-
	    rides the system default printer for the current user.

       -h server[:port]
	    Uses an alternate server.

       -l   Lists the printer specific options and their current settings.

       -o option[=value]
	    Specifies a new option for the named destination.

       -p destination[/instance]
	    Sets  the  destination and instance, if specified, for any options
	    that follow.  If the named instance does not exist then it is cre-
	    ated.   Destinations can only be created using the lpadmin(8) pro-
	    gram.

       -r option
	    Removes the specified option from the named destination.

       -x destination[/instance]
	    Removes the options for the named  destination  and  instance,  if
	    specified.	 If  the  named instance does not exist then this does
	    nothing.  Destinations can only be removed	using  the  lpadmin(8)
	    command.

FILES
       ~/.cups/lpoptions  -  user  defaults  and instances created by non-root
       users.
       /etc/cups/lpoptions - system-wide defaults and instances created by the
       root user.
