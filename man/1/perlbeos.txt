NAME
       perlbeos - Perl version 5.8+ on BeOS

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains instructions how to build Perl under BeOS and lists
       known problems.

BUILD AND INSTALL
   Requirements
       I have built and tested Perl 5.8.6 and 5.9.1 under BeOS R5 x86 net
       server.	I can't say anything with regard to PPC. Since Perl 5.8.0 had
       been released for BeOS BONE, I suspect, there is a good chance, that it
       still compiles on a BONE system. The only change I've made, that
       affects BONE systems is the recognition of whether it is a BONE system
       or not in hints/beos.sh. Now network socket support should remain
       enabled on BONE systems. This might as well break the build, though.

       As more recent versions of autoconf require flock() support, I wrote a
       flock() emulation (flock_server) and released it on BeBits:

	       http://www.bebits.com/app/4030

       If you want to build a Perl with flock() support, you have to install
       this package first.

   Configure
       With flock() support:

	       CFLAGS=-I/path/to/flock/server/headers ./configure.gnu \
		       --prefix=/boot/home/config

       Replace "/path/to/flock/server/headers" with the path to the directory
       containing the "flock.h" header.

       Without flock() support:

	       ./configure.gnu --prefix=/boot/home/config

   Build
       With flock() support:

	       make LDLOADLIBS="-lnet -lflock"

       Without flock() support:

	       make LDLOADLIBS="-lnet"

       "-lnet" is needed on net server systems only and if the compiler
       doesn't add it automatically (Be's R5 gcc does, Oliver Tappe's gcc
       2.95.3 does not).

   Install
       Install all perl files:

	       make install

       Create a symlink for libperl:

	       cd ~/config/lib; ln -s perl5/5.8.6/BePC-beos/CORE/libperl.so .

       Replace 5.8.6 with your respective version of Perl.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
       o   Network socket support is disabled for BeOS R5 net server. I didn't
	   dare yet to try enabling it and see what problems occur.

       o   The LFS (large file support) tests (t/op/lfs and xt/Fcntl/t/syslfs)
	   are disabled as seeking beyond 2 GB is broken according to
	   jhi@iki.fi who was the last one checking the BeOS port and updating
	   this file before me. Haven't checked this myself.

       o   The t/io/fflush test fails at #6. As far as I can tell, this is
	   caused by a bug in the BeOS pipes implementation that occurs when
	   starting other child processes. In the particular test case a
	   "system("perl -e 0")" flushes the stdout pipe of another child
	   process.

       o   The ext/POSIX/t/waitpid test fails at #1. After all child processes
	   are gone BeOS' waitpid(-1,...) returns 0 instead of -1 (as it
	   should). No idea how to fix this.
