DESCRIPTION
       Swift is a new, high performance systems programming language.  It has
       a clean and modern syntax, and offers seamless access to existing C and
       Objective-C code and frameworks, and is memory safe (by default).

       Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not
       itself a C-derived language. As a complete and independent language,
       Swift packages core features like flow control, data structures, and
       functions, with high-level constructs like objects, protocols,
       closures, and generics.	Swift embraces modules, eliminating the need
       for headers and the code duplication they entail.
