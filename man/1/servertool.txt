NAME
       servertool - The Java(TM) IDL Server Tool

       servertool  provides  an ease-of-use interface for application program-
       mers to register, unregister, startup and shutdown a server.

SYNOPSIS
       servertool -ORBInitialPort nameServerPort [ options ]

       The command-line tool displays with a servertool > prompt.  Enter  com-
       mands at the servertool > prompt.

       The  -ORBInitialPort  nameServerPort option is required.  The value for
       nameServerPort must specify the port on which orbd is running and  lis-
       tening  for incoming requests.  You must become root to start a process
       on a port under 1024. For this reason, we recommend that you use a port
       number greater than or equal to 1024 for the nameServerPort.

DESCRIPTION
       The  servertool provides the command-line interface for the application
       programmers to register, unregister, startup, and  shutdown  a  server.
       Other  commands	are provided to obtain various statistical information
       about the server.

OPTIONS
       -ORBInitialHost nameServerHost
	      Specifies the host machine on which the name server  is  running
	      and listening for incoming requests. The nameServerHost defaults
	      to localhost if this  option  is	not  specified.  If  orbd  and
	      servertool  are  running on different machines, you must specify
	      the name or IP address of the host on which orbd is running.

       -Joption
	      Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where option is one  of
	      the  options described on the reference page for the java appli-
	      cation launcher.	For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory
	      to  48  megabytes.  It  is  a  common  convention for -J to pass
	      options to the underlying virtual machine.

COMMANDS
       register
	      -server serverClassName -classpath classpathToServer [ -applica-
	      tionName alternateServerName -args argsToServer -vmargs flagsTo-
	      BePassedToJavaVM ]

	      Register a new server with  the  Object  Request	Broker	Daemon
	      (ORBD).	If  the server is not already registered, it is regis-
	      tered and activated.  This command causes an install  method  to
	      be  invoked  in  the  main class of the server identified by the
	      -server option. The install method must be  public  static  void
	      install(org.omg.CORBA.ORB).   The install method is optional and
	      enables the developer to provide their own  server  installation
	      behavior (for example, creating database schema).

       unregister
	      -serverid serverId | -applicationName name

	      Unregister  a server from the ORBD by using either its server id
	      or its application  name.   This	command  causes  an  uninstall
	      method  to be invoked in the main class of the server identified
	      by the -server option.  The  uninstall  method  must  be	public
	      static  void  uninstall(org.omg.CORBA.ORB). The uninstall method
	      is optional and enables  the  developer  to  provide  their  own
	      server  uninstall behavior (for example, undoing the behavior of
	      the install method).

       getserverid
	      -applicationName applicationName

	      Return the server id that corresponds with an application.

       list
	      List all information about  all  persistent  servers  registered
	      with the ORBD.

       listappnames
	      List  the  application names for all server currently registered
	      with the ORBD.

       listactive
	      List all information about all persistent servers that have been
	      launched by the ORBD and are currently running.

       locate
	      -serverid  serverId  |  -applicationName applicationName [ -end-
	      pointType endpointType ]

	      Locate the endpoints (ports) of a specific  type	for  all  ORBs
	      created  by a registered server. If a server is not already run-
	      ning, it is activated. If an endpoint  type  is  not  specified,
	      then  the  plain/non-protected endpoint associated with each ORB
	      in a server is returned.

       locateperorb
	      -serverid serverId | -applicationName applicationName  [	-orbid
	      ORB_name ]

	      Locate all the endpoints (ports) registered by a specific ORB of
	      registered server. If a server is not already running,  then  it
	      is activated. If an orbid is not specified, the default value of
	      "" is assigned to the orbid.  If any ORBs are  created  with  an
	      orbid  of empty string, all ports registered by it are returned.

       orblist
	      -serverid serverId | -applicationName applicationName ]

	      Lists the ORBId of the ORBs defined on a server.	 An  ORBId  is
	      the string name for the ORB created by the server. If the server
	      is not already running, it is activated.

       shutdown
	      -serverid serverId | -applicationName applicationName ]

	      Shutdown an  active server that is registered with ORBD.	During
	      execution  of this command, the shutdown() method defined in the
	      the class specified by either the -serverid or  -applicationName
	      parameter  is also invoked to shutdown the server process appro-
	      priately.

       startup
	      -serverid serverId | -applicationName applicationName

	      Startup or activate a server that is registered with  ORBD.   If
	      the  server is not running, this command launches the server. If
	      the server is already running, an error message is  returned  to
	      the user.

       help
	      List all the commands available to the server through the server
	      tool.

       quit
	      Exit the server tool.
