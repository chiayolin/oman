NAME
     qtmodernizer

     -- Tool to convert legacy movies to modern format with minimal changes.

SYNOPSIS
     qtmodernizer [options ...] pathToSource [pathToDestination]

DESCRIPTION
     qtmodernizer is a command line tool to examine a media file which may be
     in a legacy format or may contain legacy media tracks. In this case a
     legacy format is one which cannot be read directly by CoreMedia or
     AVFoundation frameworks.

     qtmodernizer examines all the tracks to determine if they are all in a
     form that can currently be played. If all tracks are playable and the
     format is readable, qtmodernizer does returns and does nothing. If any of
     the audio or video tracks are encoded with a codec that CoreMedia does
     not support, that track will be converted to a modern format, usually
     H.264 for video and AAC for audio (see --useprores for other choices).

     Command line options of qtmodernizer:

     -h | --help

     -p | --useprores
	      If -p or --useprores is specified, qtmodernizer will use the
	      ProRes video codec and LPCM audio codec instead of H.264 and
	      AAC-LC. For video tracks it will produce AppleProRes422. For
	      audio it will produce uncompressed output (lpcm). Tracks outher
	      than audio or video are not re-encoded and will not be affected.
	      Either AppleProRes422 may be chosen or the AppleProRes4444
	      option may be chosen but not both.

     -p4 | --useprores4444
	      If -p4 or --useprores4444 is specified, qtmodernizer will use
	      the ProRes4444 video codec and LPCM audio codec instead of H.264
	      and AAC-LC. For video tracks it will produce AppleProRes4444.
	      For audio it will produce uncompressed output (lpcm). Tracks
	      outher than audio or video are not re-encoded and will not be
	      affected. Either AppleProRes4444 may be chosen or the
	      AppleProRes422 option may be chosen but not both.

     -r | --replace
	      Normally qtmodernizer will not replace any existing files. If
	      --replace is specified, a file already existing at the destina-
	      tion path will be replaced by the new output.  qtmodernizer will
	      not replace the file at original source path used in the com-
	      mand.

     -v | --verbose
	      Normally qtmodernizer only displays important error or warning
	      messages. Specifying --verbose causes other information about
	      the modernization to be displayed on the command line.
	      --infoonly implies --verbose.

     -i | --infoonly
	      Causes qtmodernizer to display information about the tracks con-
	      tained in the source file and what the modernization process
	      would be for each track (if any) but does not actually produce
	      an output file.

EXAMPLES
	  qtmodernizer legacy_movie.mov modern_movie.mov

     Each legacy audio and video track would be re-encoded to a modern (H.264
     or AAC) track with other tracks passed through. The resulting movie is
     saved as modern_movie.mov

	  qtmodernizer -p legacy_movie.mov modern_movie.mov

     Legacy audio and video tracks would be re-encoded like in the above exam-
     ple but the resulting codecs would be ProRes for video and LPCM for audio

	  qtmodernizer ~/Movies/legacy_movie.mov

     This command will create a modernized movie in the ~/Movies directory
     named "legacy_movie-modernized.mov"
