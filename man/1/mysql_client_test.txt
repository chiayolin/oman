MYSQL_CLIENT_TEST(1)	     MySQL Database System	  MYSQL_CLIENT_TEST(1)



NAME
       mysql_client_test - test client API
       mysql_client_test_embedded - test client API for embedded server

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_client_test [options] [test_name] ...

       mysql_client_test_embedded [options] [test_name] ...

DESCRIPTION
       The mysql_client_test program is used for testing aspects of the MySQL
       client API that cannot be tested using mysqltest and its test language.
       mysql_client_test_embedded is similar but used for testing the embedded
       server. Both programs are run as part of the test suite.

       The source code for the programs can be found in in
       tests/mysql_client_test.c in a source distribution. The program serves
       as a good source of examples illustrating how to use various features
       of the client API.

       mysql_client_test is used in a test by the same name in the main tests
       suite of mysql-test-run.pl but may also be run directly. Unlike the
       other programs listed here, it does not read an external description of
       what tests to run. Instead, all tests are coded into the program, which
       is written to cover all aspects of the C language API.

       mysql_client_test supports the following options:

       o   --help, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --basedir=dir_name, -b dir_name

	   The base directory for the tests.

       o   --count=count, -t count

	   The number of times to execute the tests.

       o   --database=db_name, -D db_name

	   The database to use.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -#[debug_options]

	   Write a debugging log if MySQL is built with debugging support. The
	   default debug_options value is
	   'd:t:o,/tmp/mysql_client_test.trace'.

       o   --getopt-ll-test=option, -g option

	   Option to use for testing bugs in the getopt library.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

	   Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

	   The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
	   short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
	   and the password. If you omit the password value following the
	   --password or -p option on the command line, you are prompted for
	   one.

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

	   The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o   --server-arg=arg, -A arg

	   Argument to send to the embedded server.

       o   --show-tests, -T

	   Show all test names.

       o   --silent, -s

	   Be more silent.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

	   The socket file to use when connecting to localhost (which is the
	   default host).

       o   --testcase, -c

	   The option is used when called from mysql-test-run.pl, so that
	   mysql_client_test may optionally behave in a different way than if
	   called manually, for example by skipping some tests. Currently,
	   there is no difference in behavior but the option is included to
	   make this possible.

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

	   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   -v dir_name, --vardir=dir_name

	   The data directory for tests. The default is mysql-test/var.
