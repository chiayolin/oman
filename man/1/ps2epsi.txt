NAME
       ps2epsi - generate conforming Encapsulated PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epsi ] (Unix)
       ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epi ] (DOS)

DESCRIPTION
       ps2epsi	uses  gs(1)  to  process a PostScript(tm) file and generate as
       output a new file which conforms  to  Adobe's  Encapsulated  PostScript
       Interchange  (EPSI)  format.   EPSI  is	a special form of encapsulated
       PostScript (EPS) which adds to the beginning of the file in the form of
       PostScript  comments  a	bitmapped version of the final displayed page.
       Programs which understand EPSI (usually word  processors  or  DTP  pro-
       grams)  can  use this bitmap to give a preview version on screen of the
       PostScript.  The displayed quality is often not very  good  (e.g.,  low
       resolution,  no	colours),  but the final printed version uses the real
       PostScript, and thus has the normal PostScript quality.

USAGE
       On Unix systems invoke ps2epsi like this:

	    ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epsi ]

       where "infile.ps" is the input file and "outfile.epsi" is the resulting
       EPSI file.  If the output filename is omitted, it is generated from the
       input filename.	When a standard extension (".ps",  ".cps",  ".eps"  or
       ".epsf") is used, it is replaced with the output extension ".epsi".  On
       DOS systems the command is:

	    ps2epsi infile.ps outfile.epi

       where "infile.ps" is the original PostScript file, and "outfile.epi" is
       the name of the output file.

LIMITATIONS
       Not  every  PostScript  file  can be encapsulated successfully, because
       there are restrictions on what PostScript constructs a correct encapsu-
       lated  file  may  contain.   ps2epsi does a little extra work to try to
       help encapsulation, and it automatically calculates  the  bounding  box
       required  for all encapsulated PostScript files, so most of the time it
       does a pretty good job. There are certain to be cases,  however,  where
       the  encapsulation does not work because of the content of the original
       PostScript file.

COMPATIBILITY
       The Framemaker DTP system is one  application  which  understands  EPSI
       files,  and  ps2epsi has been tested on a number of PostScript diagrams
       from a variety of sources, using Framemaker 3.0 on a  Sun  workstation.
       Framemaker  on  other  platforms  should  be  able  to use these files,
       although I have not been able to test this.

FILES
       ps2epsi	     Unix shell script
       ps2epsi.bat   DOS batch file
       ps2epsi.ps    the Ghostscript program which does the work
