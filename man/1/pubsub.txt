NAME
     pubsub -- Utility for managing RSS/Atom subscriptions via the PubSub
     framework

SYNOPSIS
     pubsub [--client bundleID] subcommand [parameters]

ENVIRONMENT
     The pubsub tool is a command-line utility for interacting with the PubSub
     framework. It is intended for troubleshooting, as a simple way to see at
     a glance all the feed subscriptions that the agent will be periodically
     fetching, and to delete any left-over subscriptions (for example, of an
     application that's been deleted.)

     If the --client flag is given, the tool will act only on the PubSub
     client with the given bundle ID. For example, pubsub list will list only
     the feeds that client is subscribed to. Some subcommands, such as
     subscribe, require a client to be specified.

     The following subcommands are supported. Note that some have multi-word
     names. If no subcommand is given, a short listing of their names will be
     output.

     list   Lists all feeds (of all clients, or of the specific client if the
	    -client flag is given.) The title, URL and refresh interval of
	    each feed are shown. Note that a feed subscribed by multiple
	    clients will be listed once per client, and that each client may
	    specify a different refresh interval. However, the PubSub agent
	    will only fetch one copy of the feed, at the minimum interval. The
	    interval is listed in parentheses if it is inherited from the
	    client's default refresh interval. The interval is followed by a "
	    * " if the feed will be refreshed even when the client application
	    is not currently running. The interval is followed by a " * " if
	    file enclosures will automatically be downloaded.

     list clients
	    Lists all registered clients by bundle ID, along with their number
	    of subscriptions.

     list client bundleID
	    Lists only the feeds subscribed to by the given client.

     unsubscribe URL
	    Unsubscribes from the feed with the given URL.

     subscribe URL
	    Subscribes the client (which must be specified using --client ) to
	    the given feed.

     list URL
	    Lists all entries currently stored for the given feed.

     dump URL
	    Prints the raw XML of the feed, as it was last fetched from the
	    network.

     list entry identifier
	    Lists the attributes of an individual entry, given its identifier
	    (a 40-char hex string).

     dump entry identifier
	    Prints the XML of an entry, given its identifier (a 40-char hex
	    string).

     refresh URL
	    Fetches the feed from the network immediately, and updates the
	    database if it has changed.

     listen [timestamp]
	    Installs a PSClient delegate and listens for changes to subscribed
	    feeds and entries, printing messages when they occur. If a time-
	    stamp is given, all changes that have occurred since that time
	    will first be printed. The timestamp is given as a number of sec-
	    onds since the system "reference date", i.e. the same as the
	    result of -[NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate].

     list downloads
	    Lists all enclosures currently being downloaded.

     list enclosures
	    Lists all enclosures, and their current download status.
