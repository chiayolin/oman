NAME
       cpack - CPack Command-Line Reference

SYNOPSIS
	  cpack -G <generator> [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
       The "cpack" executable is the CMake packaging program.  CMake-generated
       build trees created for projects that use the INSTALL_*	commands  have
       packaging support.  This program will generate the package.

       CMake  is  a  cross-platform  build system generator.  Projects specify
       their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles  included
       in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.  Users
       build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a	native
       tool on their platform.

OPTIONS
       -G <generator>
	      Use the specified generator to generate package.

	      CPack  may  support multiple native packaging systems on certain
	      platforms.  A generator  is  responsible	for  generating  input
	      files for particular system and invoking that systems.  Possible
	      generator names are specified in the Generators section.

       -C <Configuration>
	      Specify the project configuration

	      This option specifies the configuration  that  the  project  was
	      build with, for example 'Debug', 'Release'.

       -D <var>=<value>
	      Set a CPack variable.

	      Set a variable that can be used by the generator.

       --config <config file>
	      Specify the config file.

	      Specify  the  config  file  to  use  to  create the package.  By
	      default CPackConfig.cmake in the current directory will be used.

       --verbose,-V
	      enable verbose output

	      Run cpack with verbose output.

       --debug
	      enable debug output (for CPack developers)

       -P <package name>
	      override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME

	      If  the  package	name  is  not specified on cpack commmand line
	      thenCPack.cmake defines it as CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME

       -R <package version>
	      override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION

	      If version  is  not  specified  on  cpack  command  line	thenC-

       -B <package directory>
	      override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY

	      The directory where CPack will be doing its  packaging  work.The
	      resulting  package will be found there.  Inside this directoryC-

	      temporary directory.

       --vendor <vendor name>
	      override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR

	      If  vendor  is  not  specified  on cpack command line (or inside
	      CMakeLists.txt) thenCPack.cmake defines it with a default value
