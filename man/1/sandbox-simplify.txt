NAME
     sandbox-simplify -- simplify a sandbox profile created by a trace direc-
     tive

SYNOPSIS
     sandbox-simplify file ...

DESCRIPTION
     When a profile contains a trace directive such as

	  (trace "trace.sb")

     the sandboxed process will be allowed to perform any operation, and a
     rule will be appended to the trace profile allowing access to any
     resource that would have otherwise been denied.

     The sandbox-simplify command processes a profile produced by a trace
     directive and outputs a simplified profile suitable for human inspection.
