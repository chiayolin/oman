NAME
     ypwhich -- return hostname of YP server of map master

SYNOPSIS
     ypwhich [-d domain] [[-t] -m [mname] | host]
     ypwhich -x

DESCRIPTION
     The ypwhich utility tells which YP server supplies YP services to a
     client, or which is the master for a map.	If invoked without arguments,
     it gives the YP server for the local machine.  If host is specified, that
     machine is queried to find out which YP server it is using.

     The options are as follows:

     -d domain
	     Specify a domain other than the default domain.

     -t      Inhibit translation of map nicknames to their corresponding map
	     names.

     -m [mname]
	     Find the master YP server for the named map.  No host may be
	     specified with the -m option.  The mname argument can be a map
	     name or nickname.	If mname is omitted, ypwhich will produce a
	     list of available maps.

     -x      Display the map nickname table.
