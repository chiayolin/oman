NAME
     mdimport, mdimport32 -- import file hierarchies into the metadata datas-
     tore.

SYNOPSIS
     mdimport [-VXLArgn] [-d level | category] [-w delay] file | directory
     mdimport32 [-VXLArgn] [-d level | category] [-w delay] file | directory

DESCRIPTION
     mdimport is used to test Spotlight plug-ins, list the installed plug-ins
     and schema, and re-index files handled by a plug-in when a new plug-in is
     installed.

     mdimport32 is used in exactly the same way, but for 32 bit plugins.

     The following options are available:

     -g plugin	 Load the plugin at the provided path, ignoring system
		 installed plugins.  Useful for testing plugins that have not
		 yet been installed.

     -V 	 Print timing information for this run of mdimport.

     -A 	 Print out the list of all of the attributes and their local-
		 izations in the current language and exit.

     -X 	 Print the schema file and exit

     -r 	 Ask the server to reimport files for UTIs claimed by the
		 listed plugin.  For example, the following would cause all of
		 the chat files on the system to be reimported:

		       mdimport -r /System/Library/Spotlight/Chat.mdimporter

     -p 	 Print out performance information gathered during the run.

     -L 	 Print the list of installed importers and exit.

     -d level	 Print debugging information.  Level can be 1-4.

     -n 	 Don't actually set the attributes on the file.  Useful for
		 debugging.

     -w msecs	 Wait for the specified interval between scanning files.

NOTES
     The -f switch is obsolete in Leopard and beyond.
