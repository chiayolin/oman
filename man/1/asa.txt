NAME
     asa -- interpret carriage-control characters.

SYNOPSIS
     asa [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The asa utility reads files sequentially, mapping FORTRAN carriage-con-
     trol characters to line-printer control sequences, and writes them to the
     standard output.

     The first character of each line is interpreted as a carriage-control
     character.  The following characters are interpreted as follows:

     <space>  Output the rest of the line without change.

     0	      Output a <newline> character before printing the rest of the
	      line.

     1	      Output a <formfeed> character before printing the rest of the
	      line.

     +	      The trailing <newline> of the previous line is replaced by a
	      <carriage-return> before printing the rest of the line.

     Lines beginning with characters other than the above are treated as if
     they begin with <space>.

EXAMPLES
     To view a file containing the output of a FORTRAN program:
	   asa file

     To format the output of a FORTRAN program and redirect it to a line-
     printer.
	   a.out | asa | lpr

DIAGNOSTICS
     The asa utility exit 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
