NAME
       java_home - return a value for $JAVA_HOME


SYNOPSIS
       /usr/libexec/java_home [options]


DESCRIPTION
       The java_home command returns a path suitable for setting the JAVA_HOME
       environment variable.  It determines this path from the user's  enabled
       and  preferred  JVMs  in  the Java Preferences application.  Additional
       constraints may be provided to filter the list of JVMs  available.   By
       default,  if  no  constraints  match  the  available  list of JVMs, the
       default order is used.  The path is printed to standard output.


OPTIONS
       -v or --version	version
	      Filters the returned JVMs  by  the  major  platform  version  in
	      "JVMVersion" form. Example versions: "1.5+", or "1.6*".


       -a or --arch  architecture
	      Filters  the  returned  JVMs  by	the architecture they support.
	      Example architectures: "i386", "x86_64", or "ppc".


       -d or --datamodel  datamodel
	      Filters the returned JVMs capable of running  in	32  or	64-bit
	      mode.  Supported	datamodels:  "-d32"  and  "-d64". Specifying a
	      datamodel is synonymous with specifying a  particular  architec-
	      ture.


       -t or --task  task
	      Selects from the list of JVMs which can run a specific task. The
	      order of each of these lists is  set  by	the  Java  Preferences
	      application.   Supported	tasks:	"Applets",  "WebStart",  "Bun-
	      dledApp", "JNI" and "CommandLine". The default task is "Command-
	      Line".


       -F or --failfast
	      Immediately  fails  when	filters return no JVMs; does not print
	      out the path to the default $JAVA_HOME.


       --exec  command ...
	      Executes the command at $JAVA_HOME/bin/<command> and passes  the
	      remaining arguments. Any arguments to select which $JAVA_HOME to
	      use must precede the --exec option.


       -X or --xml
	      Prints the list of selected JVMs and associated properties as an
	      XML plist to stdout.


       -V or --verbose
	      Prints the matching list of JVMs and architectures to stderr.


       -h or --help
	      Brief usage information.


USAGE
       /usr/libexec/java_home  helps  users set a $JAVA_HOME in their login rc
       files, or provides a way for command-line Java tools to	use  the  most
       appropriate  JVM  which	can  satisfy a minimum version or architecture
       requirement. The --exec argument  can  invoke  tools  in  the  selected
       $JAVA_HOME/bin  directory,  which  is useful for starting Java command-
       line tools from launchd plists without hardcoding the full path to  the
       Java command-line tool.


       Usage for bash-style shells:
	      $ export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`

       Usage for csh-style shells:
	      % setenv JAVA_HOME `/usr/libexec/java_home`
