NAME
     c99 -- standard C language compiler

SYNOPSIS
     c99 [-cEgs] [-D name[=value]] ... [-I directory ...] [-L directory ...]
	 [-o outfile] [-O optlevel] [-U name ...] [-W 32|64] operand ...

DESCRIPTION
     This is the name of the C language compiler as required by the IEEE Std
     1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'') standard.

     The c99 compiler accepts the following options:

     -c      Suppress the link-edit phase of the compilation, and do not
	     remove any object files that are produced.

     -D name[=value]
	     Define name as if by a C-language #define directive.  If no
	     ``=value'' is given, a value of 1 will be used.  Note that in
	     order to request a translation as specified by IEEE Std
	     1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1''), you need to define
	     _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L either in the source or using this
	     option.  The -D option has lower precedence than the -U option.
	     That is, if name is used in both a -U and a -D option, name will
	     be undefined regardless of the order of the options.  The -D
	     option may be specified more than once.

     -E      Copy C-language source files to the standard output, expanding
	     all preprocessor directives; no compilation will be performed.

     -g      Produce symbolic information in the object or executable files.

     -I directory
	     Change the algorithm for searching for headers whose names are
	     not absolute pathnames to look in the directory named by the
	     directory pathname before looking in the usual places.  Thus,
	     headers whose names are enclosed in double-quotes ("") will be
	     searched for first in the directory of the file with the #include
	     line, then in directories named in -I options, and last in the
	     usual places.  For headers whose names are enclosed in angle
	     brackets (<>), the header will be searched for only in directo-
	     ries named in -I options and then in the usual places.  Directo-
	     ries named in -I options shall be searched in the order speci-
	     fied.  The -I option may be specified more than once.

     -L directory
	     Change the algorithm of searching for the libraries named in the
	     -l objects to look in the directory named by the directory path-
	     name before looking in the usual places.  Directories named in -L
	     options will be searched in the order specified.  The -L option
	     may be specified more than once.

     -o outfile
	     Use the pathname outfile, instead of the default a.out, for the
	     executable file produced.

     -O optlevel
	     If optlevel is zero, disable all optimizations.  Otherwise,
	     enable optimizations at the specified level.

     -s      Produce object and/or executable files from which symbolic and
	     other information not required for proper execution has been
	     removed (stripped).

     -U name
	     Remove any initial definition of name.  The -U option may be
	     specified more than once.

     -W 32|64
	     Set the pointer size for the compiled code to either 32 or 64
	     bits.  If not specified, the pointer size matches the current
	     host architecture.

     An operand is either in the form of a pathname or the form -l library.
     At least one operand of the pathname form needs to be specified.  Sup-
     ported operands are of the form:

	   file.c      A C-language source file to be compiled and optionally
		       linked.	The operand must be of this form if the -c
		       option is used.

	   file.a      A library of object files, as produced by ar(1), passed
		       directly to the link editor.

	   file.o      An object file produced by c99 -c, and passed directly
		       to the link editor.

	   -l library  Search the library named liblibrary.a.  A library will
		       be searched when its name is encountered, so the place-
		       ment of a -l operand is significant.
