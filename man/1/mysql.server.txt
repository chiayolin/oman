NAME
       mysql.server - MySQL server startup script

SYNOPSIS
       mysql {start|stop}

DESCRIPTION
       MySQL distributions on Unix include a script named mysql.server, which
       starts the server using mysqld_safe. It can be used on systems such as
       Linux and Solaris that use System V-style run directories to start and
       stop system services. It is also used by the OS X Startup Item for
       MySQL.

       To start or stop the server manually using the mysql.server script,
       invoke it with start or stop arguments:

	   shell> mysql.server start
	   shell> mysql.server stop

       Before mysql.server starts the server, it changes location to the MySQL
       installation directory, and then invokes mysqld_safe. To run the server
       as some specific user, add an appropriate user option to the [mysqld]
       group of the /etc/my.cnf option file, as shown later in this section.
       (It is possible that you must edit mysql.server if you've installed a
       binary distribution of MySQL in a nonstandard location. Modify it to
       change location into the proper directory before it runs mysqld_safe.
       If you do this, your modified version of mysql.server may be
       overwritten if you upgrade MySQL in the future, so you should make a
       copy of your edited version that you can reinstall.)

       mysql.server stop stops the server by sending a signal to it. You can
       also stop the server manually by executing mysqladmin shutdown.

       To start and stop MySQL automatically on your server, you must add
       start and stop commands to the appropriate places in your /etc/rc*
       files.

       If you use the Linux server RPM package (MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm), or
       a native Linux package installation, the mysql.server script may be
       installed in the /etc/init.d directory with the name mysql. See
       Section 2.5.5, "Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages", for more
       information on the Linux RPM packages.

       Some vendors provide RPM packages that install a startup script under a
       different name such as mysqld.

       If you install MySQL from a source distribution or using a binary
       distribution format that does not install mysql.server automatically,
       you can install it manually. The script can be found in the
       support-files directory under the MySQL installation directory or in a
       MySQL source tree. Copy it to the /etc/init.d directory with the name
       mysql, and then make it executable:

	   shell> cp mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql
	   shell> chmod +x /etc/init.d/mysql


	   Note
	   Older Red Hat systems use the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory rather
	   than /etc/init.d. Adjust the preceding commands accordingly.
	   Alternatively, first create /etc/init.d as a symbolic link that
	   points to /etc/rc.d/init.d:

	   shell> cd /etc
	   shell> ln -s rc.d/init.d .

       After installing the script, the commands needed to activate it to run
       at system startup depend on your operating system. On Linux, you can
       use chkconfig:

	   shell> chkconfig --add mysql

       On some Linux systems, the following command also seems to be necessary
       to fully enable the mysql script:

	   shell> chkconfig --level 345 mysql on

       On FreeBSD, startup scripts generally should go in
       /usr/local/etc/rc.d/. The rc(8) manual page states that scripts in this
       directory are executed only if their basename matches the *.sh shell
       file name pattern. Any other files or directories present within the
       directory are silently ignored. In other words, on FreeBSD, you should
       install the mysql.server script as /usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql.server.sh
       to enable automatic startup.

       As an alternative to the preceding setup, some operating systems also
       use /etc/rc.local or /etc/init.d/boot.local to start additional
       services on startup. To start up MySQL using this method, append a
       command like the one following to the appropriate startup file:

	   /bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/local/mysql; ./bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &'

       For other systems, consult your operating system documentation to see
       how to install startup scripts.

       mysql.server reads options from the [mysql.server] and [mysqld]
       sections of option files. For backward compatibility, it also reads
       [mysql_server] sections, but to be current you should rename such
       sections to [mysql.server].

       You can add options for mysql.server in a global /etc/my.cnf file. A
       typical /etc/my.cnf file might look like this:

	   [mysqld]
	   datadir=/usr/local/mysql/var
	   socket=/var/tmp/mysql.sock
	   port=3306
	   user=mysql
	   [mysql.server]
	   basedir=/usr/local/mysql

       The mysql.server script supports the following options. If specified,
       they must be placed in an option file, not on the command line.
       mysql.server supports only start and stop as command-line arguments.

       o   --basedir=path

	   The path to the MySQL installation directory.

       o   --datadir=path

	   The path to the MySQL data directory.

       o   --pid-file=file_name

	   The path name of the file in which the server should write its
	   process ID.

	   If this option is not given, mysql.server uses a default value of
	   host_name.pid. The PID file value passed to mysqld_safe overrides
	   any value specified in the [mysqld_safe] option file group. Because
	   mysql.server reads the [mysqld] option file group but not the
	   [mysqld_safe] group, you can ensure that mysqld_safe gets the same
	   value when invoke using mysql.server as when invoked manually by
	   putting the same pid-file setting in both the [mysqld_safe] and
	   [mysqld] groups.

       o   --service-startup-timeout=seconds

	   How long in seconds to wait for confirmation of server startup. If
	   the server does not start within this time, mysql.server exits with
	   an error. The default value is 900. A value of 0 means not to wait
	   at all for startup. Negative values mean to wait forever (no
	   timeout).
