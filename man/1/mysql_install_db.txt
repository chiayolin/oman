NAME
       mysql_install_db - initialize MySQL data directory

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_install_db [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_install_db initializes the MySQL data directory and creates the
       system tables that it contains, if they do not exist. It also
       initializes the system tablespace and related data structures needed to
       manage InnoDB tables. As of MySQL 5.6.8, mysql_install_db is a Perl
       script and can be used on any system with Perl installed. Before 5.6.8,
       it is a shell script and is available only on Unix platforms.

       As of MySQL 5.6.8, on Unix platforms, mysql_install_db creates a
       default option file named my.cnf in the base installation directory.
       This file is created from a template included in the distribution
       package named my-default.cnf. You can find the template in or under the
       base installation directory. When started using mysqld_safe, the server
       uses my.cnf file by default. If my.cnf already exists, mysql_install_db
       assumes it to be in use and writes a new file named my-new.cnf instead.

       With one exception, the settings in the default option file are
       commented and have no effect. The exception is that the file sets the
       sql_mode system variable to NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES.
       This setting produces a server configuration that results in errors
       rather than warnings for bad data in operations that modify
       transactional tables. See Section 5.1.7, "Server SQL Modes".

       To invoke mysql_install_db, use the following syntax:

	   shell> mysql_install_db [options]

       Because the MySQL server, mysqld, must access the data directory when
       it runs later, you should either run mysql_install_db from the same
       system account that will be used for running mysqld, or run it as root
       and specify the --user option to indicate the user name that mysqld
       will run as. It might be necessary to specify other options such as
       --basedir or --datadir if mysql_install_db does not use the correct
       locations for the installation directory or data directory. For
       example:

	   shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql \
		    --basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql \
		    --datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data


	   Note
	   After mysql_install_db sets up the InnoDB system tablespace,
	   changes to some tablespace characteristics require setting up a
	   whole new instance. This includes the file name of the first file
	   in the system tablespace and the number of undo logs. If you do not
	   want to use the default values, make sure that the settings for the
	   innodb_data_file_path and innodb_log_file_size configuration
	   parameters are in place in the MySQL configuration file before
	   running mysql_install_db. Also make sure to specify as necessary
	   other parameters that affect the creation and location of InnoDB
	   files, such as innodb_data_home_dir and innodb_log_group_home_dir.

	   If those options are in your configuration file but that file is
	   not in a location that MySQL reads by default, specify the file
	   location using the --defaults-extra-file option when you run
	   mysql_install_db.

	   Note
	   If you have set a custom TMPDIR environment variable when
	   performing the installation, and the specified directory is not
	   accessible, mysql_install_db may fail. If so, unset TMPDIR or set
	   TMPDIR to point to the system temporary directory (usually /tmp).

       mysql_install_db supports the following options, which can be specified
       on the command line or in the [mysql_install_db] group of an option
       file. (Options that are common to mysqld can also be specified in the
       [mysqld] group.) Other options are passed to mysqld. For information
       about option files used by MySQL programs, see Section 4.2.6, "Using
       Option Files".

       o   --help

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --basedir=path

	   The path to the MySQL installation directory.

       o   --builddir=path

	   For use with --srcdir and out-of-source builds. Set this to the
	   location of the directory where the built files reside.

       o   --cross-bootstrap

	   For internal use. This option is used for building system tables on
	   one host intended for another.

       o   --datadir=path

	   The path to the MySQL data directory. Beginning with MySQL 5.6.8,
	   mysql_install_db is more strict about the option value. Only the
	   last component of the path name is created if it does not exist;
	   the parent directory must already exist or an error occurs.

       o   --defaults-extra-file=file_name

	   Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix)
	   before the user option file. If the file does not exist or is
	   otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
	   relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
	   rather than a full path name.

       o   --defaults-file=file_name

	   Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is
	   otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
	   relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
	   rather than a full path name.

       o   --force

	   Cause mysql_install_db to run even if DNS does not work. Grant
	   table entries normally created using host names will use IP
	   addresses instead.

       o   --keep-my-cnf

	   Tell mysql_install_db to preserve any existing my.cnf file and not
	   create a new default my.cnf file. This option was added in MySQL
	   5.6.20.

       o   --ldata=path

	   A synonym for --datadir.

       o   --no-defaults

	   Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to
	   reading unknown options from an option file, --no-defaults can be
	   used to prevent them from being read.

       o   --random-passwords

	   On Unix platforms, this option provides for more secure MySQL
	   installation. Invoking mysql_install_db with --random-passwords
	   causes it to perform the following actions in addition to its
	   normal operation:

	   o   The installation process creates a random password, assigns it
	       to the initial MySQL root accounts, and sets the "password
	       expired" flag for those accounts.

	   o   The initial random root password is written to the
	       .mysql_secret file in the directory named by the HOME
	       environment variable. Depending on operating system, using a
	       command such as sudo may cause the value of HOME to refer to
	       the home directory of the root system user.

	       If .mysql_secret already exists, the new password information
	       is appended to it. Each password entry includes a timestamp so
	       that in the event of multiple install operations it is possible
	       to determine the password associated with each one.

	       .mysql_secret is created with mode 600 to be accessible only to
	       the system user for whom it is created.

	   o   No anonymous-user MySQL accounts are created.

	   As a result of these actions, it is necessary after installation to
	   start the server, connect as root using the password written to the
	   .mysql_secret file, and specify a new root password. Until this is
	   done, root cannot do anything else. This must be done for each root
	   account you intend to use. To change the password, you can use the
	   SET PASSWORD statement (for example, with the mysql client). You
	   can also use mysqladmin or mysql_secure_installation.

	   New RPM install operations (not upgrades) invoke mysql_install_db
	   with the --random-passwords option. (Install operations using RPMs
	   for Unbreakable Linux Network are unaffected because they do not
	   use mysql_install_db.)

	   As of MySQL 5.6.9, new Solaris PKG install operations (not
	   upgrades) invoke mysql_install_db with the --random-passwords
	   option.

	   For install operations using a binary .tar.gz distribution or a
	   source distribution, you can invoke mysql_install_db with the
	   --random-passwords option manually to make your MySQL installation
	   more secure. This is recommended, particularly for sites with
	   sensitive data.

	   This option was added in MySQL 5.6.8.

       o   --rpm

	   For internal use. This option is used during the MySQL installation
	   process for install operations performed using RPM packages.

       o   --skip-name-resolve

	   Use IP addresses rather than host names when creating grant table
	   entries. This option can be useful if your DNS does not work.

       o   --srcdir=path

	   For internal use. This option specifies the directory under which
	   mysql_install_db looks for support files such as the error message
	   file and the file for populating the help tables.

       o   --user=user_name

	   The system (login) user name to use for running mysqld. Files and
	   directories created by mysqld will be owned by this user. You must
	   be the system root user to use this option. By default, mysqld runs
	   using your current login name and files and directories that it
	   creates will be owned by you.

       o   --verbose

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       o   --windows

	   For internal use. This option is used for creating Windows
	   distributions.
