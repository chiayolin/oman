NAME
       npm-publish - Publish a package

SYNOPSIS
	 npm publish <tarball> [--tag <tag>] [--access <public|restricted>]
	 npm publish <folder> [--tag <tag>] [--access <public|restricted>]

DESCRIPTION
       Publishes  a  package  to  the  registry so that it can be installed by
       name. See npm help 7 npm-developers for details on what's  included  in
       the  published package, as well as details on how the package is built.

       By default npm will publish to the public registry. This can  be  over-
       ridden by specifying a different default registry or using a npm help 7
       npm-scope in the name (see npm help 5 package.json).

       o <folder>: A folder containing a package.json file

       o <tarball>: A url or file path to a gzipped tar archive  containing  a
	 single folder with a package.json file inside.

       o [--tag  <tag>]  Registers  the  published package with the given tag,
	 such that npm install <name>@<tag> will  install  this  version.   By
	 default, npm publish updates and npm install installs the latest tag.

       o [--access <public|restricted>] Tells the registry whether this  pack-
	 age  should  be  published  as  public or restricted. Only applies to
	 scoped packages, which default to restricted.	If you	don't  have  a
	 paid account, you must publish with --access public to publish scoped
	 packages.


       Fails if the package name and version combination already exists in the
       specified registry.

       Once  a	package  is published with a given name and version, that spe-
       cific name and version combination can never be used again, even if  it
       is removed with npm help unpublish.
