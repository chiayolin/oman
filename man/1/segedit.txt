NAME
       segedit - extract and replace sections from object files

SYNOPSIS
       segedit	[  option  ]  name  ...  input_file [-extract segname sectname
       filename] ...  [[-replace segname sectname filename] ...  -output  out-
       put_file]

DESCRIPTION
       Segedit extracts and or replaces the named sections from the input_file
       and creates an output_file (if replacing a section).  The  segment  and
       section	names  are  the same as specified to ld(1) with the -segcreate
       option.	The segment and section names of an object file can  be  exam-
       ined  with  the	-l option to otool(1).	Only sections in segments that
       have no relocation to or for them can  be  replaced  (marked  with  the
       SG_NORELOC segment flag) but all sections can be extracted.

       The options to segedit(1):

       -extract segname sectname filename
	      Extracts	the section specified by the segment name section name
	      pair and places the contents in the specified filename.

       -replace segname sectname filename
	      Will replace the section specified by the segment  name  section
	      name  pair  and places and take the new contents for the section
	      from the specified filename.  The -output filename  option  must
	      also  be	specified.   The resulting size of the section will be
	      rounded to a multiple of 4 bytes and padded with zero  bytes  if
	      necessary.

       -output output_file
	      Specifies the output file to create when replacing sections.

LIMITATIONS
       Only  mach-O  format  files  that  are laid out in a contiguous address
       space and with their  contents  ordered	in  the  order	of  increasing
       address	can have their segments replaced by this program.  This layout
       is what the link editor produces by default.
