NAME
       ppdi - import ppd files (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       ppdi  [	-I include-directory ] [ -o source-file ] ppd-file [ ...  ppd-
       file ]

DESCRIPTION
       ppdi imports one or more PPD files into a  PPD  compiler  source  file.
       Multiple  languages  of	the  same  PPD	file  are merged into a single
       printer definition to facilitate accurate  changes  for	all  localiza-
       tions.	This  program  is  deprecated  and will be removed in a future
       release of CUPS.

OPTIONS
       ppdi supports the following options:

       -I include-directory
	    Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I options can
	    be supplied to add additional directories.

       -o source-file
	    Specifies  the PPD source file to update.  If the source file does
	    not exist, a new source file is created.  Otherwise  the  existing
	    file  is  merged with the new PPD file(s) on the command-line.  If
	    no source file is specified, the filename ppdi.drv is used.
