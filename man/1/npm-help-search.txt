NAME
       npm-help-search - Search npm help documentation

SYNOPSIS
	 npm help-search some search terms

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  will search the npm markdown documentation files for the
       terms provided, and then list the results, sorted by relevance.

       If only one result is found, then it will show that help topic.

       If the argument to npm help is not a known help	topic,	then  it  will
       call  help-search.  It is rarely if ever necessary to call this command
       directly.

CONFIGURATION
   long
       o Type: Boolean

       o Default false


       If true, the "long" flag  will  cause  help-search  to  output  context
       around where the terms were found in the documentation.

       If false, then help-search will just list out the help topics found.
