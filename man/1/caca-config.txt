NAME
       caca-config  - script to get information about the installed version of
       libcaca

SYNOPSIS
       caca-config [ --prefix= DIR] [ --exec-prefix=  DIR]  [  --version  ]  [
       --libs ] [ --cflags ]

DESCRIPTION
       caca-config  is a tool that is used to configure and determine the com-
       piler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link progams,
       libraries, and plugins that use libcaca.

       The  use of caca-config is deprecated. The more generic tool pkg-config
       should be used instead.

OPTIONS
       --cflags
	      Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program
	      or library that uses libcaca.

       --exec-prefix=DIR
	      If  specified,  use  DIR instead of the installation exec prefix
	      that libcaca was build with when computing the  output  for  the
	      --cflags	and  --libs  options.	This  option must be specified
	      before any of the --cflags and --libs options.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a  program  or
	      library that uses libcaca.

       --prefix=DIR
	      If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that
	      libcaca was  built  with	when  computing  the  output  for  the
	      --cflags	and  --libs options.  This option is also used for the
	      exec prefix if --exec-prefix was	not  specified.   This	option
	      must be specified before any of the --cflags and --libs options.

       --version
	      Prints the currently installed version of  libcaca  on  standard
	      output.

EXAMPLES
       gcc -o main.o $(caca-config --cflags) -c main.c
	      is  how you might use caca-config to compile a C source file for
	      an executable program.

       gcc -o my_app $(caca-config --libs) main.o util.o
	      is how you might use caca-config to link compiled  objects  into
	      an executable program.
