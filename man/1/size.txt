NAME
       size - print the size of the sections in an object file

SYNOPSIS
       size [ option ... ] [ object ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Size  (without  the  -m	option)  prints  the (decimal) number of bytes
       required by the __TEXT, __DATA and __OBJC segments.  All other segments
       are  totaled and that size is listed in the `others' column.  The final
       two columns is the sum in decimal and hexadecimal.  If no file is spec-
       ified, a.out is used.

       The options to size(1) are:

       -      Treat  the  remaining  arguments	as  name  of  object files not
	      options to size(1).

       -m     Print the sizes of the Mach-O segments and sections as  well  as
	      the  total  sizes  of the sections in each segment and the total
	      size of the segments in the file.

       -l     When used with the -m option, also print the addresses and  off-
	      sets of the sections and segments.

       -x     When  used  with	the -m option, print the values in hexadecimal
	      (with leading 0x's) rather than decimal.

       -arch arch_type
	      Specifies the architecture, arch_type, of the file  for  size(1)
	      to  operate  on when the file is a universal file.  (See arch(3)
	      for the currently know arch_types.)  The arch_type can be  "all"
	      to  operate on all architectures in the file.  The default is to
	      display only the host architecture, if  the  file  contains  it;
	      otherwise, all architectures in the file are shown.

BUGS
       The size of common symbols can't be reflected in any of the numbers for
       relocatable object files.
