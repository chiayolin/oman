NAME
       npm-ls - List installed packages

SYNOPSIS
	 npm list [[@<scope>/]<pkg> ...]
	 npm ls [[@<scope>/]<pkg> ...]
	 npm la [[@<scope>/]<pkg> ...]
	 npm ll [[@<scope>/]<pkg> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will print to stdout all the versions of packages that are
       installed, as well as their dependencies, in a tree-structure.

       Positional arguments are  name@version-range  identifiers,  which  will
       limit  the  results to only the paths to the packages named.  Note that
       nested packages will also show the paths  to  the  specified  packages.
       For example, running npm ls promzard in npm's source tree will show:

	 npm@2.12.1 /path/to/npm
	 aaa~ init-package-json@0.0.4
	   aaa promzard@0.1.5

       It will print out extraneous, missing, and invalid packages.

       If  a  project  specifies  git urls for dependencies these are shown in
       parentheses after the name@version to make it easier for users to  rec-
       ognize potential forks of a project.

       When run as ll or la, it shows extended information by default.
