NAME
       freetype-config - Get information about a libfreetype installation

SYNOPSIS
       freetype-config [options]

DESCRIPTION
       freetype-config	returns  information  needed for compiling and linking
       programs with the FreeType library, such as linker flags  and  compila-
       tion  parameters.   Alternatively,  it can be used to query information
       about the FreeType library version installed on the system, such as the
       installation (directory path) prefix or the FreeType version number.

       This program is part of the FreeType package.

OPTIONS
       There  are  two types of options: output/display selection options, and
       path override options.

   Output selection options
       Only one of the output selection options should be given at  each  pro-
       gram invocation.

       --prefix
	      Return  the  prefix value of the installed FreeType library (the
	      default prefix will be `/usr' in most  cases  for  distribution-
	      installed packages).

       --exec-prefix
	      Return  the  executable  prefix  value of the installed FreeType
	      library (will often be the same as the prefix value).

       --ftversion
	      Return the FreeType version number.

       --version
	      Return the `libtool version' of the FreeType library.

       --libtool
	      Return the library name for linking with libtool.

       --libs Return compiler flags for linking with  the  installed  FreeType
	      library.

       --cflags
	      Return  compiler	flags  for  compiling  against	the  installed
	      FreeType library.

       --static
	      Make command line options display flags for static linking.

   Path override options
       These affect any selected output option,  except  the  libtool  version
       returned by `--version'.

       --prefix=PREFIX
	      Override `--prefix' value with PREFIX.

       --exec-prefix=EPREFIX
	      Override `--exec-prefix' value with EPREFIX.

BUGS
       In  case  the  libraries  FreeType links to are located in non-standard
       directories, the output from option --libs might be incomplete.	It  is
       thus  recommended  to use the pkg-config(1) interface instead, which is
       able to correctly resolve all dependencies.
