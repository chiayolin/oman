NAME
       ccmake - CMake Curses Dialog Command-Line Reference

SYNOPSIS
	  ccmake [<options>] (<path-to-source> | <path-to-existing-build>)

DESCRIPTION
       The "ccmake" executable is the CMake curses interface.  Project config-
       uration settings may  be  specified  interactively  through  this  GUI.
       Brief  instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal when the
       program is running.

       CMake is a cross-platform build	system	generator.   Projects  specify
       their  build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included
       in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.  Users
       build  a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native
       tool on their platform.

OPTIONS
       -C <initial-cache>
	      Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

	      When cmake is first run in an empty build  tree,	it  creates  a
	      CMakeCache.txt  file and populates it with customizable settings
	      for the project.	This option may be used to specify a file from
	      which  to  load  cache entries before the first pass through the
	      project's cmake listfiles.  The  loaded  entries	take  priority
	      over  the  project's default values.  The given file should be a
	      CMake script containing SET commands that use the CACHE  option,
	      not a cache-format file.

       -D <var>:<type>=<value>, -D <var>=<value>
	      Create a cmake cache entry.

	      When  cmake  is  first  run in an empty build tree, it creates a
	      CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable  settings
	      for  the	project.  This option may be used to specify a setting
	      that takes priority  over  the  project's  default  value.   The
	      option may be repeated for as many cache entries as desired.

	      If  the  :<type>	portion  is  given it must be one of the types
	      specified by the set() command documentation for its CACHE  sig-
	      nature.	If  the  :<type>  portion is omitted the entry will be
	      created with no type if it does not exist with a	type  already.
	      If  a  command  in the project sets the type to PATH or FILEPATH
	      then the <value> will be converted to an absolute path.

	      This  option  may  also  be  given   as	a   single   argument:
	      -D<var>:<type>=<value> or -D<var>=<value>.

       -U <globbing_expr>
	      Remove matching entries from CMake cache.

	      This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the
	      CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using * and ? are sup-
	      ported.  The option may be repeated for as many cache entries as
	      desired.

	      Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt non-working.

       -G <generator-name>
	      Specify a build system generator.

	      CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain plat-
	      forms.   A  generator is responsible for generating a particular
	      build system.  Possible generator names  are  specified  in  the
	      cmake-generators(7) manual.

       -T <toolset-name>
	      Specify toolset name if supported by generator.

	      Some  CMake generators support a toolset name to be given to the
	      native build system to choose a  compiler.   This  is  supported
	      only on specific generators:

		 Visual Studio >= 10
		 Xcode >= 3.0

	      See native build system documentation for allowed toolset names.

       -A <platform-name>
	      Specify platform name if supported by generator.

	      Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the
	      native  build  system to choose a compiler or SDK.  This is sup-
	      ported only on specific generators:

		 Visual Studio >= 8

	      See native  build  system  documentation	for  allowed  platform
	      names.

       -Wno-dev
	      Suppress developer warnings.

	      Suppress	warnings  that	are meant for the author of the CMake-
	      Lists.txt files.

       -Wdev  Enable developer warnings.

	      Enable warnings that are meant for  the  author  of  the	CMake-
	      Lists.txt files.
