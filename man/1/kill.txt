NAME
     kill -- terminate or signal a process

SYNOPSIS
     kill [-s signal_name] pid ...
     kill -l [exit_status]
     kill -signal_name pid ...
     kill -signal_number pid ...

DESCRIPTION
     The kill utility sends a signal to the processes specified by the pid op-
     erand(s).

     Only the super-user may send signals to other users' processes.

     The options are as follows:

     -s signal_name
	     A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead
	     of the default TERM.

     -l [exit_status]
	     If no operand is given, list the signal names; otherwise, write
	     the signal name corresponding to exit_status.

     -signal_name
	     A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead
	     of the default TERM.

     -signal_number
	     A non-negative decimal integer, specifying the signal to be sent
	     instead of the default TERM.

     The following pids have special meanings:
     -1      If superuser, broadcast the signal to all processes; otherwise
	     broadcast to all processes belonging to the user.

     Some of the more commonly used signals:
     1	     HUP (hang up)
     2	     INT (interrupt)
     3	     QUIT (quit)
     6	     ABRT (abort)
     9	     KILL (non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
     14      ALRM (alarm clock)
     15      TERM (software termination signal)

     Some shells may provide a builtin kill command which is similar or iden-
     tical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

STANDARDS
     The kill function is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') compat-
     ible.

HISTORY
     A kill command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.

BUGS
     A replacement for the command ``kill 0'' for csh(1) users should be pro-
     vided.
