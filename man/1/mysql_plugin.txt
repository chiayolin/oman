NAME
       mysql_plugin - configure MySQL server plugins

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_plugin [options] plugin {ENABLE|DISABLE}

DESCRIPTION
       The mysql_plugin utility enables MySQL administrators to manage which
       plugins a MySQL server loads. It provides an alternative to manually
       specifying the --plugin-load option at server startup or using the
       INSTALL PLUGIN and UNINSTALL PLUGIN statements at runtime.
       mysql_plugin is available as of MySQL 5.6.3.

       Depending on whether mysql_plugin is invoked to enable or disable
       plugins, it inserts or deletes rows in the mysql.plugin table that
       serves as a plugin registry. (To perform this operation, mysql_plugin
       invokes the MySQL server in bootstrap mode. This means that the server
       must not already be running.) For normal server startups, the server
       loads and enables plugins listed in mysql.plugin automatically. For
       additional control over plugin activation, use --plugin_name options
       named for specific plugins, as described in Section 5.1.8.1,
       "Installing and Uninstalling Plugins".

       Each invocation of mysql_plugin reads a configuration file to determine
       how to configure the plugins contained in a single plugin library
       object file. To invoke mysql_plugin, use this syntax:

	   mysql_plugin [options] plugin {ENABLE|DISABLE}

       plugin is the name of the plugin to configure.  ENABLE or DISABLE (not
       case sensitive) specify whether to enable or disable components of the
       plugin library named in the configuration file. The order of the plugin
       and ENABLE or DISABLE arguments does not matter.

       For example, to configure components of a plugin library file named
       myplugins.so on Linux or myplugins.dll on Windows, specify a plugin
       value of myplugins. Suppose that this plugin library contains three
       plugins, plugin1, plugin2, and plugin3, all of which should be
       configured under mysql_plugin control. By convention, configuration
       files have a suffix of .ini and the same basename as the plugin
       library, so the default configuration file name for this plugin library
       is myplugins.ini. The configuration file contents look like this:

	   myplugins
	   plugin1
	   plugin2
	   plugin3

       The first line in the myplugins.ini file is the name of the library
       object file, without any extension such as .so or .dll. The remaining
       lines are the names of the components to be enabled or disabled. Each
       value in the file should be on a separate line. Lines on which the
       first character is '#' are taken as comments and ignored.

       To enable the plugins listed in the configuration file, invoke
       mysql_plugin this way:

	   shell> mysql_plugin myplugins ENABLE

       To disable the plugins, use DISABLE rather than ENABLE.

       An error occurs if mysql_plugin cannot find the configuration file or
       plugin library file, or if mysql_plugin cannot start the MySQL server.

       mysql_plugin supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysqld] group of any option file. For
       options specified in a [mysqld] group, mysql_plugin recognizes the
       --basedir, --datadir, and --plugin-dir options and ignores others. For
       information about option files used by MySQL programs, see
       Section 4.2.6, "Using Option Files".

       o   --help, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --basedir=path, -b path

	   The server base directory.

       o   --datadir=path, -d path

	   The server data directory.

       o   --my-print-defaults=path, -b path

	   The path to the my_print_defaults program.

       o   --mysqld=path, -b path

	   The path to the mysqld server.

       o   --no-defaults, -p

	   Do not read values from the configuration file. This option enables
	   an administrator to skip reading defaults from the configuration
	   file.

	   With mysql_plugin, this option need not be given first on the
	   command line, unlike most other MySQL programs that support
	   --no-defaults.

       o   --plugin-dir=path, -p path

	   The server plugin directory.

       o   --plugin-ini=file_name, -i file_name

	   The mysql_plugin configuration file. Relative path names are
	   interpreted relative to the current directory. If this option is
	   not given, the default is plugin.ini in the plugin directory, where
	   plugin is the plugin argument on the command line.

       o   --print-defaults, -P

	   Display the default values from the configuration file. This option
	   causes mysql_plugin to print the defaults for --basedir, --datadir,
	   and --plugin-dir if they are found in the configuration file. If no
	   value for a variable is found, nothing is shown.

	   With mysql_plugin, this option need not be given first on the
	   command line, unlike most other MySQL programs that support
	   --print-defaults.

       o   --verbose, -v

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
	   This option can be used multiple times to increase the amount of
	   information.

       o   --version, -V

	   Display version information and exit.
