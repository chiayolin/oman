NAME
       ppdmerge - merge ppd files (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       ppdmerge [ -o output-ppd-file ] ppd-file ppd-file [ ...	ppd-file ]

DESCRIPTION
       ppdmerge merges two or more PPD files into a single, multi-language PPD
       file.  This program is deprecated and  will  be	removed  in  a	future
       release of CUPS.

OPTIONS
       ppdmerge supports the following options:

       -o output-ppd-file
	      Specifies  the PPD file to create.  If not specified, the merged
	      PPD file is written to the standard output.  If the output  file
	      already exists, it is silently overwritten.

NOTES
       ppdmerge  does  not check whether the merged PPD files are for the same
       device.	Merging of different  device  PPDs  will  yield  unpredictable
       results.
