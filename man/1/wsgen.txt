NAME
       wsgen - JAX-WS 2.0


SYNOPSIS
       wsgen [options] SEI

DESCRIPTION
       The  wsgen  tool generates JAX-WS portable artifacts used in JAX-WS web
       services. The tool reads a web service  endpoint  implementation  class
       (SEI)  and generates all the required artifacts for web service deploy-
       ment, and invocation.

OPTIONS
       -classpath path
	      Specify where to find input class files

       -cp path
	      Same as -classpath

       -d directory
	      Specify where to place generated output files

       -extension
	      allow vendor extensions  (functionality  not  specified  by  the
	      specification).	Use  of  extensions may result in applications
	      that are not portable or may not interoperate with other	imple-
	      mentations.

       -help  Display help

       -keep  Keep generated files

       -r directory
	      Used only in conjunction with the -wsdl option. Specify where to
	      place generated resource files such as WSDLs.

       -s directory
	      Specify where to place generated source files

       -verbose
	      Output messages about what the compiler is doing

       -version
	      Print version information.  Use of this option will  ONLY  print
	      version information.  Normal processing will not occur.

       -wsdl[:protocol]
	      By  default  wsgen  does	not generate a WSDL file. This flag is
	      optional and will cause wsgen to generate a  WSDL  file  and  is
	      usually  only  used  so  that the developer can look at the WSDL
	      before the endpoint is deploy. The protocol is optional  and  is
	      used  to	specify what protocol should be used in the wsdl:bind-
	      ing. Valid protocols include: soap1.1 and Xsoap1.2. The  default
	      is  soap1.1.   Xsoap1.2  is not standard and can only be used in
	      conjunction with the -extension option.

       -servicename name
	      Used only in conjunction with the -wsdl option. Used to  specify
	      a  particular  wsdl:service  name  to  be generated in the WSDL.
	      Example, -servicename "{http://mynamespace/}MyService"

       -portname name
	      Used only in conjunction with the -wsdl option. Used to  specify
	      a  particular wsdl:port name to be generated in the WSDL.  Exam-
	      ple, -portname "{http://mynamespace/}MyPort"

Example
       wsgen -cp . -wsdl fromjava.server.AddNumbersImpl

       This generates the portable JAX-WS artifacts that are required for  Web
       Service	deployment.   It  also	generates the WSDL for the Web Service
       with the -wsdl option.
