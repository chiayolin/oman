NAME
       ps2ps, eps2eps - Ghostscript PostScript "distiller"

SYNOPSIS
       ps2ps [ options ] input.ps output.ps
       eps2eps [ options ] input.eps output.eps

DESCRIPTION
       ps2ps  uses gs(1) to convert PostScript(tm) file "input.ps" to simpler,
       normalized and (usually) faster PostScript  in  "output.ps".   Normally
       the  output is allowed to use PostScript Level 2 or Level 3 constructs,
       but the -dLanguageLevel=1 option restricts the output to Level 1.

       eps2eps performs the equivalent	optimization  for  Encapsulated  Post-
       Script (EPS) files.

       Both  accept  any general Ghostscript command line options, and respec-
       tively options specific to the pswrite and epswrite devices.

FILES
       Run "gs -h" to find the location of Ghostscript documentation  on  your
       system, from which you can get more details.

BUGS
       The  pswrite  device used by both ps2ps and eps2eps produces much lower
       level output than is desirable. Use with caution.
