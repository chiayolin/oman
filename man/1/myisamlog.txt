NAME
       myisamlog - display MyISAM log file contents

SYNOPSIS
       myisamlog [options] [log_file [tbl_name] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       myisamlog processes the contents of a MyISAM log file. To create such a
       file, start the server with a --log-isam=log_file option.

       Invoke myisamlog like this:

	   shell> myisamlog [options] [file_name [tbl_name] ...]

       The default operation is update (-u). If a recovery is done (-r), all
       writes and possibly updates and deletes are done and errors are only
       counted. The default log file name is myisam.log if no log_file
       argument is given. If tables are named on the command line, only those
       tables are updated.

       myisamlog supports the following options:

       o   -?, -I

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   -c N
