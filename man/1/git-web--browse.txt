NAME
       git-web--browse - Git helper script to launch a web browser

SYNOPSIS
       git web--browse [OPTIONS] URL/FILE ...


DESCRIPTION
       This script tries, as much as possible, to display the URLs and FILEs
       that are passed as arguments, as HTML pages in new tabs on an already
       opened web browser.

       The following browsers (or commands) are currently supported:

       o   firefox (this is the default under X Window when not using KDE)

       o   iceweasel

       o   seamonkey

       o   iceape

       o   chromium (also supported as chromium-browser)

       o   google-chrome (also supported as chrome)

       o   konqueror (this is the default under KDE, see Note about konqueror
	   below)

       o   opera

       o   w3m (this is the default outside graphical environments)

       o   elinks

       o   links

       o   lynx

       o   dillo

       o   open (this is the default under Mac OS X GUI)

       o   start (this is the default under MinGW)

       o   cygstart (this is the default under Cygwin)

       o   xdg-open

       Custom commands may also be specified.

OPTIONS
       -b <browser>, --browser=<browser>
	   Use the specified browser. It must be in the list of supported
	   browsers.

       -t <browser>, --tool=<browser>
	   Same as above.

       -c <conf.var>, --config=<conf.var>
	   CONF.VAR is looked up in the Git config files. If it's set, then
	   its value specifies the browser that should be used.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
   CONF.VAR (from -c option) and web.browser
       The web browser can be specified using a configuration variable passed
       with the -c (or --config) command-line option, or the web.browser
       configuration variable if the former is not used.

   browser.<tool>.path
       You can explicitly provide a full path to your preferred browser by
       setting the configuration variable browser.<tool>.path. For example,
       you can configure the absolute path to firefox by setting
       browser.firefox.path. Otherwise, git web--browse assumes the tool is
       available in PATH.

   browser.<tool>.cmd
       When the browser, specified by options or configuration variables, is
       not among the supported ones, then the corresponding browser.<tool>.cmd
       configuration variable will be looked up. If this variable exists then
       git web--browse will treat the specified tool as a custom command and
       will use a shell eval to run the command with the URLs passed as
       arguments.

NOTE ABOUT KONQUEROR
       When konqueror is specified by a command-line option or a configuration
       variable, we launch kfmclient to try to open the HTML man page on an
       already opened konqueror in a new tab if possible.

       For consistency, we also try such a trick if browser.konqueror.path is
       set to something like A_PATH_TO/konqueror. That means we will try to
       launch A_PATH_TO/kfmclient instead.

       If you really want to use konqueror, then you can use something like
       the following:

		   [web]
			   browser = konq

		   [browser "konq"]
			   cmd = A_PATH_TO/konqueror


   Note about git-config --global
       Note that these configuration variables should probably be set using
       the --global flag, for example like this:

	   $ git config --global web.browser firefox


       as they are probably more user specific than repository specific. See
       git-config(1) for more information about this.
