NAME
       mysqlimport - a data import program

SYNOPSIS
       mysqlimport [options] db_name textfile1 ...

DESCRIPTION
       The mysqlimport client provides a command-line interface to the LOAD
       DATA INFILE SQL statement. Most options to mysqlimport correspond
       directly to clauses of LOAD DATA INFILE syntax. See Section 13.2.6,
       "LOAD DATA INFILE Syntax".

       Invoke mysqlimport like this:

	   shell> mysqlimport [options] db_name textfile1 [textfile2 ...]

       For each text file named on the command line, mysqlimport strips any
       extension from the file name and uses the result to determine the name
       of the table into which to import the file's contents. For example,
       files named patient.txt, patient.text, and patient all would be
       imported into a table named patient.

       mysqlimport supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysqlimport] and [client] groups of an
       option file. For information about option files used by MySQL programs,
       see Section 4.2.6, "Using Option Files".

       o   --help, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --bind-address=ip_address

	   On a computer having multiple network interfaces, use this option
	   to select which interface to use for connecting to the MySQL
	   server.

	   This option is supported beginning with MySQL 5.6.1.

       o   --character-sets-dir=path

	   The directory where character sets are installed. See Section 10.5,
	   "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --columns=column_list, -c column_list

	   This option takes a comma-separated list of column names as its
	   value. The order of the column names indicates how to match data
	   file columns with table columns.

       o   --compress, -C

	   Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
	   both support compression.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

	   Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
	   d:t:o,file_name. The default is d:t:o.

       o   --debug-check

	   Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       o   --debug-info

	   Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics
	   when the program exits.

       o   --default-character-set=charset_name

	   Use charset_name as the default character set. See Section 10.5,
	   "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --default-auth=plugin

	   A hint about the client-side authentication plugin to use. See
	   Section 6.3.7, "Pluggable Authentication".

	   This option was added in MySQL 5.6.2.

       o   --defaults-extra-file=file_name

	   Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix)
	   before the user option file. If the file does not exist or is
	   otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
	   relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
	   rather than a full path name.

       o   --defaults-file=file_name

	   Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is
	   otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
	   relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
	   rather than a full path name.

       o   --defaults-group-suffix=str

	   Read not only the usual option groups, but also groups with the
	   usual names and a suffix of str. For example, mysqlimport normally
	   reads the [client] and [mysqlimport] groups. If the
	   --defaults-group-suffix=_other option is given, mysqlimport also
	   reads the [client_other] and [mysqlimport_other] groups.

       o   --delete, -D

	   Empty the table before importing the text file.

       o   --fields-terminated-by=..., --fields-enclosed-by=...,
	   --fields-optionally-enclosed-by=..., --fields-escaped-by=...

	   These options have the same meaning as the corresponding clauses
	   for LOAD DATA INFILE. See Section 13.2.6, "LOAD DATA INFILE
	   Syntax".

       o   --force, -f

	   Ignore errors. For example, if a table for a text file does not
	   exist, continue processing any remaining files. Without --force,
	   mysqlimport exits if a table does not exist.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

	   Import data to the MySQL server on the given host. The default host
	   is localhost.

       o   --ignore, -i

	   See the description for the --replace option.

       o   --ignore-lines=N

	   Ignore the first N lines of the data file.

       o   --lines-terminated-by=...

	   This option has the same meaning as the corresponding clause for
	   LOAD DATA INFILE. For example, to import Windows files that have
	   lines terminated with carriage return/linefeed pairs, use
	   --lines-terminated-by="\r\n". (You might have to double the
	   backslashes, depending on the escaping conventions of your command
	   interpreter.) See Section 13.2.6, "LOAD DATA INFILE Syntax".

       o   --local, -L

	   Read input files locally from the client host.

       o   --lock-tables, -l

	   Lock all tables for writing before processing any text files. This
	   ensures that all tables are synchronized on the server.

       o   --login-path=name

	   Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login
	   path file. A "login path" is an option group that permits only a
	   limited set of options: host, user, and password. Think of a login
	   path as a set of values that indicate the server host and the
	   credentials for authenticating with the server. To create the login
	   path file, use the mysql_config_editor utility. See
	   mysql_config_editor(1). This option was added in MySQL 5.6.6.

       o   --low-priority

	   Use LOW_PRIORITY when loading the table. This affects only storage
	   engines that use only table-level locking (such as MyISAM, MEMORY,
	   and MERGE).

       o   --no-defaults

	   Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to
	   reading unknown options from an option file, --no-defaults can be
	   used to prevent them from being read.

	   The exception is that the .mylogin.cnf file, if it exists, is read
	   in all cases. This permits passwords to be specified in a safer way
	   than on the command line even when --no-defaults is used.
	   (.mylogin.cnf is created by the mysql_config_editor utility. See
	   mysql_config_editor(1).)

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

	   The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
	   short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
	   and the password. If you omit the password value following the
	   --password or -p option on the command line, mysqlimport prompts
	   for one.

	   Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
	   insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
	   Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
	   on the command line.

       o   --pipe, -W

	   On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe. This option
	   applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

       o   --plugin-dir=path

	   The directory in which to look for plugins. It may be necessary to
	   specify this option if the --default-auth option is used to specify
	   an authentication plugin but mysqlimport does not find it. See
	   Section 6.3.7, "Pluggable Authentication".

	   This option was added in MySQL 5.6.2.

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

	   The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o   --print-defaults

	   Print the program name and all options that it gets from option
	   files.

       o   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

	   The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
	   useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
	   protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the
	   permissible values, see Section 4.2.2, "Connecting to the MySQL
	   Server".

       o   --replace, -r

	   The --replace and --ignore options control handling of input rows
	   that duplicate existing rows on unique key values. If you specify
	   --replace, new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique
	   key value. If you specify --ignore, input rows that duplicate an
	   existing row on a unique key value are skipped. If you do not
	   specify either option, an error occurs when a duplicate key value
	   is found, and the rest of the text file is ignored.

       o   --secure-auth

	   Do not send passwords to the server in old (pre-4.1) format. This
	   prevents connections except for servers that use the newer password
	   format. This option is enabled by default; use --skip-secure-auth
	   to disable it. This option was added in MySQL 5.6.17.

	       Note
	       Passwords that use the pre-4.1 hashing method are less secure
	       than passwords that use the native password hashing method and
	       should be avoided. Pre-4.1 passwords are deprecated and support
	       for them will be removed in a future MySQL release. For account
	       upgrade instructions, see Section 6.3.8.3, "Migrating Away from
	       Pre-4.1 Password Hashing and the mysql_old_password Plugin".

       o   --shared-memory-base-name=name

	   On Windows, the shared-memory name to use, for connections made
	   using shared memory to a local server. The default value is MYSQL.
	   The shared-memory name is case sensitive.

	   The server must be started with the --shared-memory option to
	   enable shared-memory connections.

       o   --silent, -s

	   Silent mode. Produce output only when errors occur.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

	   For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
	   Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       o   --ssl*

	   Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the
	   server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and
	   certificates. See Section 6.3.10.4, "SSL Command Options".

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

	   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --use-threads=N

	   Load files in parallel using N threads.

       o   --verbose, -v

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       o   --version, -V

	   Display version information and exit.

       Here is a sample session that demonstrates use of mysqlimport:

	   shell> mysql -e 'CREATE TABLE imptest(id INT, n VARCHAR(30))' test
	   shell> ed
	   a
	   100	   Max Sydow
	   101	   Count Dracula
	   .
	   w imptest.txt
	   32
	   q
	   shell> od -c imptest.txt
	   0000000   1	 0   0	\t   M	 a   x	     S	 y   d	 o   w	\n   1	 0
	   0000020   1	\t   C	 o   u	 n   t	     D	 r   a	 c   u	 l   a	\n
	   0000040
	   shell> mysqlimport --local test imptest.txt
	   test.imptest: Records: 2  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
	   shell> mysql -e 'SELECT * FROM imptest' test
	   +------+---------------+
	   | id   | n		  |
	   +------+---------------+
	   |  100 | Max Sydow	  |
	   |  101 | Count Dracula |
	   +------+---------------+
