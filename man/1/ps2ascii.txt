NAME
       ps2ascii - Ghostscript translator from PostScript or PDF to ASCII

SYNOPSIS
       ps2ascii [ input.ps [ output.txt ] ]
       ps2ascii input.pdf [ output.txt ]

DESCRIPTION
       ps2ascii  uses gs(1) to extract ASCII text from PostScript(tm) or Adobe
       Portable Document Format (PDF) files. If no files are specified on  the
       command	line,  gs  reads  from standard input; but PDF input must come
       from an explicitly-named file, not standard input.  If no  output  file
       is specified, the ASCII text is written to standard output.

       ps2ascii  doesn't look at font encoding, and isn't very good at dealing
       with kerning, so for PostScript (but not currently PDF), you might con-
       sider pstotext (see below).

FILES
       Run  "gs  -h" to find the location of Ghostscript documentation on your
       system, from which you can get more details.
