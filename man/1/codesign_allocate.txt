NAME
       codesign_allocate -  add code signing data to a Mach-O file

SYNOPSIS
       codesign_allocate  -i  oldfile [ -a arch size ]... [ -A cputype cpusub-
       type size ]... -o newfile

DESCRIPTION
       codesign_allocate sets up a Mach-O file used by the dynamic  linker  so
       space  for  code  signing  data of the specified size for the specified
       architecture is embedded in the	Mach-O	file.	The  program  must  be
       passed  one  -a	argument or one -A argument for each architecture in a
       universal file, or exactly one -a or -A for a thin file.

       -i oldfile
	      specifies the input file as oldfile.

       -o newfile
	      specifies the output file as newfile.

       -a arch size
	      specifies for the architecture arch that the size  of  the  code
	      signing  data is to be size.  The value of size must be a multi-
	      ple of 16.

       -a cputype cpusubtype size
	      specifies for the architecture as a pair of decimal integers for
	      the  cputype  and  cpusubtype  that the size of the code signing
	      data is to be size.  The value of size must be a multiple of 16.
