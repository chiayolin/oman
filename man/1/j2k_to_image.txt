j2k_to_image(1) 	    converts jpeg2000 files	       j2k_to_image(1)



NAME
       j2k_to_image  -	This program reads in a jpeg2000 image and converts it
       to another image type. It is part of the OpenJPEG library.

       Valid input image extensions are .j2k, .jp2, .j2c, .jpt

       Valid output image extensions are .bmp, .pgm, .pgx, .png,  .pnm,  .ppm,
       .raw, .tga, .tif . For PNG resp. TIF it needs libpng resp. libtiff .

SYNOPSIS
       j2k_to_image -i infile.j2k -o outfile.png

       j2k_to_image -ImgDir images/ -OutFor bmp

       j2k_to_image -h Print help message and exit

       See JPWL OPTIONS for special options

OPTIONS
       -i name
	      (jpeg2000 input file name)

       -l n   n  is the maximum number of quality layers to decode. See LAYERS
	      below)

       -o name
	      (output file name with extension)

       -r n   (n is the highest resolution level to be discarded.  See	REDUC-
	      TION below)

       -x name
	      (use name as index file and fill it)

       -ImgDir directory_name
	      (directory containing input files)

       -OutFor ext
	      (extension for output files)


JPWL OPTIONS
       Options usable only if the library has been compiled with -DUSE_JPWL

       -W  c[=Nc]  (Nc is the number of expected components in the codestream;
       default:3)

       -W  t[=Nt]  (Nt	is  the  maximum  number  of  tiles in the codestream;
       default:8192)

       -W c[=Nc], t[=Nt] (same as above)


REDUCTION
       Set the number of highest resolution levels to be discarded.  The image
       resolution is effectively divided by 2 to the power of  the  number  of
       discarded  levels.  The	reduce factor is limited by the smallest total
       number of decomposition levels among tiles.

TILES
       Set the maximum number of quality layers to decode. If there  are  less
       quality	layers	than  the specified number, all the quality layers are
       decoded.
