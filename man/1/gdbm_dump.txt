NAME
       gdbm_dump - dump a GDBM database to a file

SYNOPSIS
       gdbm_dump [-H FMT] [--format=FMT] DB_FILE [FILE]

       gdbm_dump [-Vh] [--help] [--usage] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       The  gdbm_dump utility creates a dump of the specified gdbm(3) database
       file.  The name for the output dump file  is  supplied  by  the	second
       argument  (FILE).   If  not  specified, the output goes to the standard
       error.

       The created dump can be given as argument to the  gdbm_load(1)  utility
       in order to re-create an exact copy of the DB_FILE.

OPTIONS
       -H, --format=FMT
	      Select dump format.  The value binary (or 0) instructs gdbm_dump
	      to produce a binary dump, compatible with earlier gdbm  versions
	      (up  to  version	1.9).	The value ascii (or 1) instructs it to
	      create an ASCII dump (this is the default).  The latter is  pre-
	      ferred  because,	apart  from  the actual data, it also contains
	      meta-information which will allow gdbm_load(1)  to  recreate  an
	      exact copy of the file.

       -h, --help
	      Print a short usage summary.

       --usage
	      Print a list of available options.

       -V, --version
	      Print program version
