NAME
       perl588delta - what is new for perl v5.8.8

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.8.7 release and the
       5.8.8 release.

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.8.7. If any
       exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

Core Enhancements
       o   "chdir", "chmod" and "chown" can now work on filehandles as well as
	   filenames, if the system supports respectively "fchdir", "fchmod"
	   and "fchown", thanks to a patch provided by Gisle Aas.

	       sections correctly, rather than doing the "misguided" work it
	       was previously doing.  Note that "canonpath" on Unix still does

       o   "threads" upgraded to version 1.07

	   o   "threads" will now honour "no warnings 'threads'"

	   o   A thread's interpreter is now freed after "$t->join()" rather
	       than after "undef $t", which should fix some "ithreads" memory
	       leaks. (Fixed by Dave Mitchell)

Utility Changes
   "h2xs" enhancements
       "h2xs" implements new option "--use-xsloader" to force use of
       "XSLoader" even in backwards compatible modules.

       The handling of authors' names that had apostrophes has been fixed.

       Any enums with negative values are now skipped.

   "perlivp" enhancements
       "perlivp" implements new option "-a" and will not check for *.ph files
       by default any more.  Use the "-a" option to run all tests.

New Documentation
       The perlglossary manpage is a glossary of terms used in the Perl
       documentation, technical and otherwise, kindly provided by O'Reilly
       Media, inc.

Performance Enhancements
       o   Weak reference creation is now O(1) rather than O(n), courtesy of
	   Nicholas Clark. Weak reference deletion remains O(n), but if
	   deletion only happens at program exit, it may be skipped
	   completely.

       o   Salvador Fandin~o provided improvements to reduce the memory usage
	   of "sort" and to speed up some cases.

       o   Jarkko Hietaniemi and Andy Lester worked to mark as much data as
	   possible in the C source files as "static", to increase the
	   proportion of the executable file that the operating system can
	   share between process, and thus reduce real memory usage on multi-
	   user systems.

Installation and Configuration Improvements
       Parallel makes should work properly now, although there may still be
       problems if "make test" is instructed to run in parallel.

       Building with Borland's compilers on Win32 should work more smoothly.
       In particular Steve Hay has worked to side step many warnings emitted
       by their compilers and at least one C compiler internal error.

       "Configure" will now detect "clearenv" and "unsetenv", thanks to a
       patch from Alan Burlison. It will also probe for "futimes" and whether
       "sprintf" correctly returns the length of the formatted string, which
       will both be used in perl 5.8.9.

       There are improved hints for next-3.0, vmesa, IX, Darwin, Solaris,
       Linux, DEC/OSF, HP-UX and MPE/iX

       Perl extensions on Windows now can be statically built into the Perl
       DLL, thanks to a work by Vadim Konovalov. (This improvement was
       actually in 5.8.7, but was accidentally omitted from perl587delta).

Selected Bug Fixes
   no warnings 'category' works correctly with -w
       Previously when running with warnings enabled globally via "-w",
       selective disabling of specific warning categories would actually turn
       off all warnings.  This is now fixed; now "no warnings 'io';" will only
       turn off warnings in the "io" class. Previously it would erroneously
       turn off all warnings.

       This bug fix may cause some programs to start correctly issuing
       warnings.

   Remove over-optimisation
       Perl 5.8.4 introduced a change so that assignments of "undef" to a
       scalar, or of an empty list to an array or a hash, were optimised away.
       As this could cause problems when "goto" jumps were involved, this
       change has been backed out.

   sprintf() fixes
       Using the sprintf() function with some formats could lead to a buffer
       overflow in some specific cases. This has been fixed, along with
       several other bugs, notably in bounds checking.

       In related fixes, it was possible for badly written code that did not
       follow the documentation of "Sys::Syslog" to have formatting
       vulnerabilities.  "Sys::Syslog" has been changed to protect people from
       poor quality third party code.

   Debugger and Unicode slowdown
       It had been reported that running under perl's debugger when processing
       Unicode data could cause unexpectedly large slowdowns. The most likely
       cause of this was identified and fixed by Nicholas Clark.

   Smaller fixes
       o   "FindBin" now works better with directories where access rights are
	   more restrictive than usual.

       o   Several memory leaks in ithreads were closed. An improved
	   implementation of "threads::shared" is available on CPAN - this
	   will be merged into 5.8.9 if it proves stable.

       o   Trailing spaces are now trimmed from $! and $^E.

       o   Operations that require perl to read a process's list of groups,
	   such as reads of $( and $), now dynamically allocate memory rather
	   than using a fixed sized array. The fixed size array could cause C
	   stack exhaustion on systems configured to use large numbers of
	   groups.

       o   "PerlIO::scalar" now works better with non-default $/ settings.

       o   You can now use the "x" operator to repeat a "qw//" list. This used
	   to raise a syntax error.

       o   The debugger now traces correctly execution in eval("")uated code
	   that contains #line directives.

       o   The value of the "open" pragma is no longer ignored for three-
	   argument opens.

       o   The optimisation of "for (reverse @a)" introduced in perl 5.8.6
	   could misbehave when the array had undefined elements and was used
	   in LVALUE context. Dave Mitchell provided a fix.

       o   Some case insensitive matches between UTF-8 encoded data and 8 bit
	   regexps, and vice versa, could give malformed character warnings.
	   These have been fixed by Dave Mitchell and Yves Orton.

       o   "lcfirst" and "ucfirst" could corrupt the string for certain cases
	   where the length UTF-8 encoding of the string in lower case, upper
	   case or title case differed. This was fixed by Nicholas Clark.

       o   Perl will now use the C library calls "unsetenv" and "clearenv" if
	   present to delete keys from %ENV and delete %ENV entirely, thanks
	   to a patch from Alan Burlison.

New or Changed Diagnostics
   Attempt to set length of freed array
       This is a new warning, produced in situations such as this:

	   $r = do {my @a; \$#a};
	   $$r = 503;

   Non-string passed as bitmask
       This is a new warning, produced when number has been passed as a
       argument to select(), instead of a bitmask.

	   # Wrong, will now warn
	   $rin = fileno(STDIN);
	   ($nfound,$timeleft) = select($rout=$rin, undef, undef, $timeout);

	   # Should be
	   $rin = '';
	   vec($rin,fileno(STDIN),1) = 1;
	   ($nfound,$timeleft) = select($rout=$rin, undef, undef, $timeout);

   Search pattern not terminated or ternary operator parsed as search pattern
       This syntax error indicates that the lexer couldn't find the final
       delimiter of a "?PATTERN?" construct. Mentioning the ternary operator
       in this error message makes it easier to diagnose syntax errors.

Changed Internals
       There has been a fair amount of refactoring of the "C" source code,
       partly to make it tidier and more maintainable. The resulting object
       code and the "perl" binary may well be smaller than 5.8.7, in
       particular due to a change contributed by Dave Mitchell which reworked
       the warnings code to be significantly smaller. Apart from being smaller
       and possibly faster, there should be no user-detectable changes.

       Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine which function
       parameters and local variables could actually be declared "const" to
       the C compiler. Steve Peters provided new *_set macros and reworked the
       core to use these rather than assigning to macros in LVALUE context.

       Dave Mitchell improved the lexer debugging output under "-DT"

       Nicholas Clark changed the string buffer allocation so that it is now
       rounded up to the next multiple of 4 (or 8 on platforms with 64 bit
       pointers). This should reduce the number of calls to "realloc" without
       actually using any extra memory.

       The "HV"'s array of "HE*"s is now allocated at the correct (minimal)
       size, thanks to another change by Nicholas Clark. Compile with
       "-DPERL_USE_LARGE_HV_ALLOC" to use the old, sloppier, default.

       For XS or embedding debugging purposes, if perl is compiled with
       "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS_FORK_DUMP" in addition to
       "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS" then a child process is "fork"ed just before
       global destruction, which is used to display the values of any scalars
       found to have leaked at the end of global destruction. Without this,
       the scalars have already been freed sufficiently at the point of
       detection that it is impossible to produce any meaningful dump of their
       contents.  This feature was implemented by the indefatigable Nicholas
       Clark, based on an idea by Mike Giroux.

Platform Specific Problems
       The optimiser on HP-UX 11.23 (Itanium 2) is currently partly disabled
       (scaled down to +O1) when using HP C-ANSI-C; the cause of problems at
       higher optimisation levels is still unclear.

       There are a handful of remaining test failures on VMS, mostly due to
       test fixes and minor module tweaks with too many dependencies to
       integrate into this release from the development stream, where they
       have all been corrected.  The following is a list of expected failures
       with the patch number of the fix where that is known:

	   ext/Devel/PPPort/t/ppphtest.t  #26913
	   ext/List/Util/t/p_tainted.t	  #26912
	   lib/ExtUtils/t/PL_FILES.t	  #26813
	   lib/ExtUtils/t/basic.t	  #26813
	   t/io/fs.t
	   t/op/cmp.t

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at http://bugs.perl.org.  There may also be information at
       http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
       of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
       the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at
       http://bugs.perl.org/
