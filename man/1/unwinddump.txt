NAME
     unwinddump -- Displays compact unwind information in an executable

SYNOPSIS
     unwinddump [-arch arch-name] file(s)

DESCRIPTION
     When a C++ (or x86_64 Objective-C) exception is thrown, the runtime must
     unwind the stack looking for some function to catch the exception.  Tra-
     ditionally, the unwind information is stored in the __TEXT/__eh_frame
     section of each executable as Dwarf CFI (call frame information).	Begin-
     ning in Mac OS X 10.6, the unwind information is also encoded in the
     __TEXT/__unwind_info section using a two-level lookup table of compact
     unwind encodings.

     The unwinddump tool displays the content of the __TEXT/__unwind_info sec-
     tion.
