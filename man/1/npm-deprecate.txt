NAME
       npm-deprecate - Deprecate a version of a package

SYNOPSIS
	 npm deprecate <name>[@<version>] <message>

DESCRIPTION
       This  command will update the npm registry entry for a package, provid-
       ing a deprecation warning to all who attempt to install it.

       It works on version ranges as well as specific versions, so you can  do
       something like this:

	 npm deprecate my-thing@"< 0.2.3" "critical bug fixed in v0.2.3"

       Note  that  you	must be the package owner to deprecate something.  See
       the owner and adduser help topics.

       To un-deprecate a package, specify an empty string ("") for the message
       argument.
