NAME
       zprint - show information about kernel zones

SYNOPSIS
       zprint [-w] [-s] [-c] [-h] [-t] [-d] [-p <pid>][name]

DESCRIPTION
       zprint(1)  displays  data  about  Mach  zones.  By default, zprint will
       print out information about all Mach zones.  If the  optional  name  is
       specified, zprint will print information about each zone for which name
       is a substring of the zone's name.

       zprint interprets the following options:

       -c      (Default) zprint prints zone info in columns. Long  zone  names
	       are  truncated  with  '$', and spaces are replaced with '.', to
	       allow for sorting by column.  Pageable  and  collectible  zones
	       are shown with 'P' and 'C' on the far right. Zones with prepos-
	       terously large maximum sizes are shown with '----' in  the  max
	       size and max num elts fields.

       -h      (Default)  Shows  headings  for the columns printed with the -c
	       option.	It may be useful to override this option when  sorting
	       by column.

       -s      zprint  sorts the zones, showing the zone wasting the most mem-
	       ory first.

       -w      For each zone, zprint calculates how much  space  is  allocated
	       but not currently in use, the space wasted by the zone.

       -t      For  each zone, zprint calculates the total size of allocations
	       from the zone over the life of the zone.

       -d      Display deltas over time, showing any zones that have  achieved
	       a  new maximum current allocation size during the interval.  If
	       the total allocation sizes are being displayed for the zones in
	       question,  it will also display the deltas if the total alloca-
	       tions have doubled.  -p <pid> Display zone usage related to the
	       specified  process id.  Each zone will display standard columns
	       and the amount of memory from that zone associated with a given
	       process.   The  letter  "A"  in the flags column indicates that
	       this total is being accounted to the process.   Otherwise,  the
	       total  is an indication of the influence the process has on the
	       kernel, but the memory is being accounted to the kernel proper.

       Any  option (including default options) can be overridden by specifying
       the option in upper-case;  for  example,  -C  overrides	the  (default)
       option -c.
