NAME
       mysqldumpslow - Summarize slow query log files

SYNOPSIS
       mysqldumpslow [options] [log_file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The MySQL slow query log contains information about queries that take a
       long time to execute (see Section 5.2.5, "The Slow Query Log").
       mysqldumpslow parses MySQL slow query log files and prints a summary of
       their contents.

       Normally, mysqldumpslow groups queries that are similar except for the
       particular values of number and string data values. It "abstracts"
       these values to N and 'S' when displaying summary output. The -a and -n
       options can be used to modify value abstracting behavior.

       Invoke mysqldumpslow like this:

	   shell> mysqldumpslow [options] [log_file ...]

       mysqldumpslow supports the following options.

       o   --help

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   -a

	   Do not abstract all numbers to N and strings to 'S'.

       o   --debug, -d

	   Run in debug mode.

       o   -g pattern

	   Consider only queries that match the (grep-style) pattern.

       o   -h host_name

	   Host name of MySQL server for *-slow.log file name. The value can
	   contain a wildcard. The default is * (match all).

       o   -i name

	   Name of server instance (if using mysql.server startup script).

       o   -l

	   Do not subtract lock time from total time.

       o   -n N

	   Abstract numbers with at least N digits within names.

       o   -r

	   Reverse the sort order.

       o   -s sort_type

	   How to sort the output. The value of sort_type should be chosen
	   from the following list:

	   o   t, at: Sort by query time or average query time

	   o   l, al: Sort by lock time or average lock time

	   o   r, ar: Sort by rows sent or average rows sent

	   o   c: Sort by count

	   By default, mysqldumpslow sorts by average query time (equivalent
	   to -s at).

       o   -t N

	   Display only the first N queries in the output.

       o   --verbose, -v

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       Example of usage:

	   shell> mysqldumpslow
	   Reading mysql slow query log from /usr/local/mysql/data/mysqld51-apple-slow.log
	   Count: 1  Time=4.32s (4s)  Lock=0.00s (0s)  Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
	    insert into t2 select * from t1
	   Count: 3  Time=2.53s (7s)  Lock=0.00s (0s)  Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
	    insert into t2 select * from t1 limit N
	   Count: 3  Time=2.13s (6s)  Lock=0.00s (0s)  Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
	    insert into t1 select * from t1
