NAME
       replace - a string-replacement utility

SYNOPSIS
       replace arguments

DESCRIPTION
       The replace utility program changes strings in place in files or on the
       standard input.

       Invoke replace in one of the following ways:

	   shell> replace from to [from to] ... -- file_name [file_name] ...
	   shell> replace from to [from to] ... < file_name

       from represents a string to look for and to represents its replacement.
       There can be one or more pairs of strings.

       Use the -- option to indicate where the string-replacement list ends
       and the file names begin. In this case, any file named on the command
       line is modified in place, so you may want to make a copy of the
       original before converting it.  replace prints a message indicating
       which of the input files it actually modifies.

       If the -- option is not given, replace reads the standard input and
       writes to the standard output.

       replace uses a finite state machine to match longer strings first. It
       can be used to swap strings. For example, the following command swaps a
       and b in the given files, file1 and file2:

	   shell> replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...

       The replace program is used by msql2mysql. See msql2mysql(1).

       replace supports the following options.

       o   -?, -I

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   -#debug_options

	   Enable debugging.

       o   -s

	   Silent mode. Print less information what the program does.

       o   -v

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       o   -V

	   Display version information and exit.
