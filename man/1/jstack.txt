NAME
       jstack - stack trace

SYNOPSIS
       jstack [ option ] pid
       jstack [ option ] executable core
       jstack [ option ] [server-id@]remote-hostname-or-IP

DESCRIPTION
       jstack  prints  Java  stack  traces  of	Java  threads for a given Java
       process or core file or a remote debug server. For each Java frame, the
       full  class name, method name, 'bci' (byte code index) and line number,
       if available, are printed. With the -m option, jstack prints both  Java
       and native frames of all threads along with the 'pc' (program counter).
       For each native frame, the closest native symbol to 'pc', if available,
       is printed. C++ mangled names are not demangled. To demangle C++ names,
       the output of this command may be piped to c++filt.

       NOTE - This utility is unsupported and may or may not be  available  in
       future  versions of the J2SE SDK.  jstack is not currently available on
       Windows platforms or on the Linux Itanium platform.

PARAMETERS
       Options are mutually exclusive. Option, if used, should follow  immedi-
       ately after the command name.

       pid	      process  id  for	which the stacktrace is to be printed.
		      The process must be a Java process. To  get  a  list  of
		      Java processes running on a machine, jps may be used.

       executable     Java executable from which the core dump was produced.

       core	      core file for which the stack trace is to be printed.

       remote-hostname-or-IP
		      remote  debug  server's  (see  jsadebugd) hostname or IP
		      address.

       server-id      optional unique id, if multiple debug servers  are  run-
		      ning on the same remote host.

OPTIONS
       -m	      prints  mixed  mode  (both Java and native C/C++ frames)
		      stack trace.

       -h	      Prints a help message.

       -help	      Prints a help message.

SEE ALSO

KNOWN BUGS
       Mixed mode stack trace, the -m option, does not work  with  the	remote
       debug server.
