NAME
       resolve_stack_dump - resolve numeric stack trace dump to symbols

SYNOPSIS
       resolve_stack_dump [options] symbols_file [numeric_dump_file]

DESCRIPTION
       resolve_stack_dump resolves a numeric stack dump to symbols.

       Invoke resolve_stack_dump like this:

	   shell> resolve_stack_dump [options] symbols_file [numeric_dump_file]

       The symbols file should include the output from the nm --numeric-sort
       mysqld command. The numeric dump file should contain a numeric stack
       track from mysqld. If no numeric dump file is named on the command
       line, the stack trace is read from the standard input.

       resolve_stack_dump supports the following options.

       o   --help, -h

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --numeric-dump-file=file_name, -n file_name

	   Read the stack trace from the given file.

       o   --symbols-file=file_name, -s file_name

	   Use the given symbols file.

       o   --version, -V

	   Display version information and exit.
