NAME
       ImageMagick  -  is a free software suite for the creation, modification
       and display of bitmap images.

SYNOPSIS
       convert input-file [options] output-file

OVERVIEW
       ImageMagick(R), is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap
       images.	It  can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats
       (about 100) including GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG,  PDF,  PhotoCD,  TIFF,
       and  DPX.  Use  ImageMagick  to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
       shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various  special
       effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and B\['e]zier curves.

       ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distri-
       bution  or  as  source  code that you can freely use, copy, modify, and
       distribute. Its license is compatible with the  GPL.  It  runs  on  all
       major operating systems.

       The functionality of ImageMagick is typically utilized from the command
       line or you can use the features from programs written in your favorite
       programming  language.  Choose  from  these interfaces: MagickCore (C),
       MagickWand (C), ChMagick (Ch), Magick++ (C++), JMagick (Java), L-Magick
       (Lisp),	PascalMagick  (Pascal),  PerlMagick (Perl), MagickWand for PHP
       (PHP), PythonMagick (Python), RMagick (Ruby),  or  TclMagick  (Tcl/TK).
       With  a	language interface, use ImageMagick to modify or create images
       automagically and dynamically.

       ImageMagick includes a number of command-line utilities for  manipulat-
       ing  images. Most of you are probably accustom to editing images one at
       a time with a graphical user interface (GUI) with such programs as gimp
       or Photoshop. However, a GUI is not always convenient. Suppose you want
       to process an image dynamically from a web script or you want to  apply
       the  same  operations  to many images or repeat a specific operation at
       different times to the same or different  image.  For  these  types  of
       operations, the command-line image processing utility is appropriate.

       In the paragraphs below, find a short description for each command-line
       tool.Cl ick on the program name to get details on the program usage and
       a  list	of comman d-line options that alters how the program performs.
       If you are just getting acq uainted with ImageMagick, start at the  top
       of the list, the convert program, and
	work  your way down. Also be sure to peruse Anthony Thyssen's tutorial
       on how to
	use ImageMagick utilities to convert, compose, or edit images from the
       command- line.

       convert

	      convert  between image formats as well as resize an image, blur,
	      crop, despeckle, dither, draw on,  flip,	join,  re-sample,  and
	      much more.

       identify

	      describes  the  format  and characteristics of one or more image
	      files.

       mogrify

	      resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw  on,  flip,
	      join,  re-sample, and much more. Mogrify overwrites the original
	      image file, whereas, convert writes to a different image file.

       composite

	      overlaps one image over another.

       montage

	      create a composite image by combining several  separate  images.
	      The  images  are tiled on the composite image optionally adorned
	      with a border, frame, image name, and more.

       compare

	      mathematically and visually annotate the difference  between  an
	      image and its reconstruction..


       stream  is a lightweight tool to stream one or more pixel components of
	      the image or portion of the image to your choice of storage for-
	      mats.  It  writes the pixel components as they are read from the
	      input image a row at a time making stream desirable when working
	      with large images or when you require raw pixel components.


       display

	      displays an image or image sequence on any X server.

       animate

	      animates an image sequence on any X server.

       import	saves  any  visible window on an X server and outputs it as an
	      image file. You can capture a single window, the entire  screen,
	      or any rectangular portion of the screen.

       conjure

	      interprets  and executes scripts written in the Magick Scripting
	      Language (MSL).
