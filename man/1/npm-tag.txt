NAME
       npm-tag - Tag a published version

SYNOPSIS
	 npm tag <name>@<version> [<tag>]

DESCRIPTION
       THIS COMMAND IS DEPRECATED. See npm help dist-tag for details.

       Tags  the  specified  version of the package with the specified tag, or
       the --tag config if not specified.

       A tag can be used when installing packages as a reference to a  version
       instead of using a specific version number:

	 npm install <name>@<tag>

       When  installing dependencies, a preferred tagged version may be speci-
       fied:

	 npm install --tag <tag>

       This also applies to npm dedupe.

       Publishing a package always sets the "latest" tag to the published ver-
       sion.

PURPOSE
       Tags  can  be used to provide an alias instead of version numbers.  For
       example, npm currently uses the tag "next"  to  identify  the  upcoming
       version, and the tag "latest" to identify the current version.

       A  project  might choose to have multiple streams of development, e.g.,
       "stable", "canary".

CAVEATS
       Tags must share a namespace with  version  numbers,  because  they  are
       specified  in the same slot: npm install <pkg>@<version> vs npm install
       <pkg>@<tag>.

       Tags that can be interpreted as valid semver ranges will  be  rejected.
       For example, v1.4 cannot be used as a tag, because it is interpreted by
       semver as >=1.4.0 <1.5.0.  See  https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6082.

       The simplest way to avoid semver problems with tags is to use tags that
       do not begin with a number or the letter v.
