NAME
       cupstestdsc - test conformance of postscript files (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       cupstestdsc [ -h ] filename.ps [ ...  filenameN.ps ]
       cupstestdsc [ -h ] -

DESCRIPTION
       cupstestdsc  tests  the	conformance  of  PostScript files to the Adobe
       PostScript Language Document Structuring Conventions Specification ver-
       sion  3.0.  The results of testing and any other output are sent to the
       standard output.  The second form of the command reads PostScript  from
       the standard input.

NOTES
       This  program  is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of
       CUPS.

       cupstestdsc only validates the DSC comments in a  PostScript  file  and
       does  not  attempt  to validate the PostScript code itself.  Developers
       must ensure that the PostScript they generate follows the rules defined
       by  Adobe.   Specifically, all pages must be independent of each other,
       code outside page descriptions may not affect the graphics state  (cur-
       rent font, color, transform matrix, etc.), and device-specific commands
       such as setpagedevice should not be used.
