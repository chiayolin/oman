NAME
       ntpd - NTP daemon program

SYNOPSIS
       ntpd [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name [[=| ]value]]...

       All arguments must be options.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the ntpd command.


OPTIONS
       -4, --ipv4
	      Force  IPv4 DNS name resolution.	This option must not appear in
	      combination with any of the following options: ipv6.

	      Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
	      to the IPv4 namespace.

       -6, --ipv6
	      Force  IPv6 DNS name resolution.	This option must not appear in
	      combination with any of the following options: ipv4.

	      Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
	      to the IPv6 namespace.

       -a, --authreq
	      Require  crypto  authentication.	This option must not appear in
	      combination with any of the following options: authnoreq.

	      Require cryptographic authentication for broadcast client,  mul-
	      ticast  client  and symmetric passive associations.  This is the
	      default.

       -A, --authnoreq
	      Do not require crypto  authentication.   This  option  must  not
	      appear  in  combination  with  any  of  the  following  options:
	      authreq.

	      Do  not  require	cryptographic  authentication  for   broadcast
	      client,  multicast  client  and  symmetric passive associations.
	      This is almost never a good idea.

       -b, --bcastsync
	      Allow us to sync to broadcast servers.



       -c string, --configfile=string
	      configuration file name.

	      The name and path of the configuration  file,  /etc/ntp.conf  by
	      default.

       -d, --debug-level
	      Increase	output debug message level.  This option may appear an
	      unlimited number of times.

	      Increase the debugging message output level.

       -D string, --set-debug-level=string
	      Set the output debug message level.  This option may  appear  an
	      unlimited number of times.

	      Set the output debugging level.  Can be supplied multiple times,
	      but each overrides the previous value(s).

       -f string, --driftfile=string
	      frequency drift file name.

	      The name and path  of  the  frequency  file,  /etc/ntp.drift  by
	      default.	 This is the same operation as the driftfile driftfile
	      configuration specification in the /etc/ntp.conf file.

       -g, --panicgate
	      Allow the first adjustment to be Big.  This option may appear an
	      unlimited number of times.

	      Normally,  ntpd  exits  with  a message to the system log if the
	      offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by  default.
	      This  option  allows  the  time  to  be set to any value without
	      restriction; however, this can happen only once. If the  thresh-
	      old is exceeded after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the
	      system log. This option can be used with the -q and -x  options.
	      See the tinker configuration file directive for other options.

       -i string, --jaildir=string
	      Jail directory.

	      Chroot  the  server  to  the  directory jaildir This option also
	      implies that the server attempts	to  drop  root	privileges  at
	      startup.	You may need to also specify a -u option.  This option
	      is only available if the OS supports adjusting the clock without
	      full  root  privileges.	This  option is supported under NetBSD
	      (configure with --enable-clockctl ) and  Linux  (configure  with
	      --enable-linuxcaps ).

       -I iface, --interface=iface
	      Listen  on an interface name or address.	This option may appear
	      an unlimited number of times.

	      Open the network address given, or all the addresses  associated
	      with  the given interface name.  This option may appear multiple
	      times.  This option also implies not  opening  other  addresses,
	      except  wildcard	and  localhost.   This	option	is deprecated.
	      Please consider using the configuration file interface  command,
	      which is more versatile.

       -k string, --keyfile=string
	      path to symmetric keys.

	      Specify	the   name   and  path	of  the  symmetric  key  file.
	      /etc/ntp.keys is the default.  This is the same operation as the
	      keys keyfile configuration file directive.

       -l string, --logfile=string
	      path to the log file.

	      Specify  the  name and path of the log file.  The default is the
	      system log file.	This is the same operation as the logfile log-
	      file configuration file directive.

       -L, --novirtualips
	      Do not listen to virtual interfaces.

	      Do not listen to virtual interfaces, defined as those with names
	      containing a colon.  This option is deprecated.  Please consider
	      using  the  configuration  file interface command, which is more
	      versatile.

       -M, --modifymmtimer
	      Modify Multimedia Timer (Windows only).

	      Set the Windows Multimedia Timer to  highest  resolution.   This
	      ensures  the  resolution	does not change while ntpd is running,
	      avoiding timekeeping glitches associated with changes.

       -n, --nofork
	      Do not fork.



       -N, --nice
	      Run at high priority.

	      To the extent permitted by the operating system, run ntpd at the
	      highest priority.

       -p string, --pidfile=string
	      path to the PID file.

	      Specify  the  name  and  path  of the file used to record ntpd's
	      process ID.  This is the same operation as the  pidfile  pidfile
	      configuration file directive.

       -P number, --priority=number
	      Process  priority.   This  option takes an integer number as its
	      argument.

	      To the extent permitted by the operating system, run ntpd at the
	      specified sched_setscheduler(SCHED_FIFO) priority.

       -q, --quit
	      Set the time and quit.

	      ntpd  will exit just after the first time the clock is set. This
	      behavior mimics that of the ntpdate  program,  which  is	to  be
	      retired.	 The  -g  and -x options can be used with this option.
	      Note: The kernel time discipline is disabled with this option.

       -r string, --propagationdelay=string
	      Broadcast/propagation delay.

	      Specify the default propagation delay from the  broadcast/multi-
	      cast  server to this client. This is necessary only if the delay
	      cannot be computed automatically by the protocol.

       --saveconfigquit=string
	      Save parsed configuration and quit.

	      Cause ntpd to parse its startup configuration file and  save  an
	      equivalent  to  the  given  filename  and exit.  This option was
	      designed for automated testing.

       -s string, --statsdir=string
	      Statistics file location.

	      Specify the directory path for files created by  the  statistics
	      facility.   This	is the same operation as the statsdir statsdir
	      configuration file directive.

       -t tkey, --trustedkey=tkey
	      Trusted key number.  This option may appear an unlimited	number
	      of times.

	      Add a key number to the trusted key list.

       -u string, --user=string
	      Run as userid (or userid:groupid).

	      Specify  a  user,  and  optionally  a group, to switch to.  This
	      option is only available if the OS supports adjusting the  clock
	      without  full  root  privileges.	This option is supported under
	      NetBSD (configure with --enable-clockctl ) and Linux  (configure
	      with --enable-linuxcaps ).

       -U number, --updateinterval=number
	      interval in seconds between scans for new or dropped interfaces.
	      This option takes an integer number as its argument.

	      Give the time in seconds between two scans for  new  or  dropped
	      interfaces.   For  systems with routing socket support the scans
	      will be performed shortly after the interface  change  has  been
	      detected	by  the system.  Use 0 to disable scanning. 60 seconds
	      is the minimum time between scans.

       --var=nvar
	      make ARG an ntp variable (RW).  This option may appear an unlim-
	      ited number of times.



       --dvar=ndvar
	      make  ARG  an  ntp variable (RW|DEF).  This option may appear an
	      unlimited number of times.



       -x, --slew
	      Slew up to 600 seconds.

	      Normally, the time is slewed if the offset is less than the step
	      threshold,  which is 128 ms by default, and stepped if above the
	      threshold.  This option sets the threshold to 600  s,  which  is
	      well  within  the  accuracy  window  to  set the clock manually.
	      Note: Since the slew rate of typical Unix kernels is limited  to
	      0.5  ms/s,  each	second	of adjustment requires an amortization
	      interval of 2000 s.  Thus, an adjustment as much as 600  s  will
	      take  almost  14 days to complete.  This option can be used with
	      the -g and -q options.  See the tinker configuration file direc-
	      tive  for  other	options.   Note: The kernel time discipline is
	      disabled with this option.

       --usepcc
	      Use CPU cycle counter (Windows only).

	      Attempt to substitute  the  CPU  counter	for  QueryPerformance-
	      Counter.	 The  CPU counter and QueryPerformanceCounter are com-
	      pared, and if they have the  same  frequency,  the  CPU  counter
	      (RDTSC on x86) is used directly, saving the overhead of a system
	      call.

       --pccfreq=string
	      Force CPU cycle counter use (Windows only).

	      Force substitution the CPU counter for  QueryPerformanceCounter.
	      The  CPU counter (RDTSC on x86) is used unconditionally with the
	      given frequency (in Hz).

       -?, --help
	      Display extended usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
	      Extended usage information passed thru pager.

       - [{v|c|n}], --version[={v|c|n}]
	      Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v',  a
	      simple  version.	 The `c' mode will print copyright information
	      and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

OPTION PRESETS
       Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by load-
       ing values from environment variables named:
	 NTPD_<option-name> or NTPD
