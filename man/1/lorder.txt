NAME
     lorder -- list dependencies for object files

SYNOPSIS
     lorder file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The lorder utility uses nm(1) to determine interdependencies in the list
     of object files specified on the command line.  lorder outputs a list of
     file names where the first file contains a symbol which is defined by the
     second file.

     The output is normally used with tsort(1) when a library is created to
     determine the optimum ordering of the object modules so that all refer-
     ences may be resolved in a single pass of the loader.

EXAMPLES
	   ar cr library.a `lorder ${OBJS} | tsort`
