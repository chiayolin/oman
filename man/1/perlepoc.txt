NAME
       perlepoc - Perl for EPOC

SYNOPSIS
       Perl 5 README file for the EPOC Release 5 operating system.

INTRODUCTION
       EPOC is an OS for palmtops and mobile phones. For more information look
       at: <http://www.symbian.com/>

       This is a port of perl to the epocemx SDK by Eberhard Mattes, which
       itself uses the SDK by symbian. Essentially epocemx it is a POSIX look
       alike environment for the EPOC OS.  For more information look at:
       <http://epocemx.sourceforge.net/>

       perl and epocemx runs on Epoc Release 5 machines: Psion 5mx, 5mx Pro,
       Psion Revo, Psion Netbook and on the Ericsson M128. It may run on Epoc
       Release 3 Hardware (Series 5 classic), too. For more information about
       this hardware please refer to <http://www.psion.com/>

       Vendors which like to have support for their devices are free to send
       me a sample.

INSTALLING PERL ON EPOC
       You can download a ready-to-install version from
       <http://www.oflebbe.de/perl/perl5.html>

       You will need at least ~6MB free space in order to install and run
       perl.

       Please install the emxusr.sis package from
       <http://epocemx.sourceforge.net/> first.

       Install perl.sis on the EPOC machine. If you do not know how to do
       that, consult your PsiWin documentation.

       Perl itself and its standard library is using 4 MB disk space.  Unicode
       support and some other modules are left out. (For details, please look
       into epoc/createpkg.pl). If you like to use these modules, you are free
       to copy them from a current perl release.

STARTING PERL ON EPOC
       Please use the epocemx shell to start perl. perl integrates with the
       conventions of epocemx.

   Features of Perl on Epoc
       The built-in function EPOC::getcwd returns the current directory.

   Restrictions of Perl on Epoc
       Features are left out, because of restrictions of the POSIX support in
       EPOC:

       o   socket IO is only implemented poorly. You can only use sysread and
	   syswrite on them. The commands read, write, print, <> do not work
	   for sockets. This may change iff epocemx supports sockets.

       o   kill, alarm and signals. Do not try to use them. This may be
	   impossible to implement on EPOC.

       o   select is missing.

       o   binmode does not exist. (No CR LF to LF translation for text files)

       o   EPOC does not handle the notion of current drive and current
	   directory very well (i.e. not at all, but it tries hard to emulate
	   one). See PATH.

       o   Heap is limited to 4MB.

       o   Dynamic loading is not implemented.

   Compiling Perl 5 on the EPOC cross compiling environment
       Sorry, this is far too short.

       o   You will need the epocemx SDK from Eberhard Mattes.

       o   Get the Perl sources from your nearest CPAN site.

       o   Unpack the sources.

       o   Build a native perl from this sources... Make sure to save the
	   miniperl executable as miniperl.native.

	   Start again from scratch

		 cp epoc/* .
		 ./Configure -S
		 make
		 cp miniperl.native miniperl
		 touch miniperl.exe
		 make
		 perl createpkg.pl

		 emxsis perl.pkg perl.sis

SUPPORT STATUS OF PERL ON EPOC
       I'm offering this port "as is". You can ask me questions, but I can't
       guarantee I'll be able to answer them. Since the port to epocemx is
       quite new, please check the web for updates first.

       Very special thanks to Eberhard Mattes for epocemx.
