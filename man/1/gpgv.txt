NAME
       gpgv - Verify OpenPGP signatures

SYNOPSIS
       gpgv [options] signed_files





DESCRIPTION
       gpgv is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

       This  program  is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only
       able to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than  the  fully-blown
       gpg  and  uses  a  different (and simpler) way to check that the public
       keys used to make the signature are valid. There are  no  configuration
       files and only a few options are implemented.

       gpgv  assumes  that all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.  That does
       also mean that it does not check for expired or revoked keys.

       By default a keyring named `trustedkeys.gpg'  is  used.	 This  default
       keyring	is  assumed  to  be in the home directory of GnuPG, either the
       default home directory or the one set by an option  or  an  environment
       variable.   The	option	--keyring  may	be used to specify a different
       keyring or even multiple keyrings.




RETURN VALUE
       The program returns 0 if everything is fine, 1 if at least  one	signa-
       ture was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.


OPTIONS
       gpgv recognizes these options:



       --verbose

       -v     Gives  more  information	during	processing. If used twice, the
	      input data is listed in detail.


       --quiet

       -q     Try to be as quiet as possible.


       --keyring file
	      Add file to the list of keyrings.  If file begins with  a  tilde
	      and  a  slash,  these are replaced by the HOME directory. If the
	      filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to  be  in  the
	      home-directory ("~/.gnupg" if --homedir is not used).


       --status-fd n
	      Write  special status strings to the file descriptor n.  See the
	      file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.


       --logger-fd n
	      Write log output to file descriptor n and not to stderr.


       --ignore-time-conflict
	      GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated  with  keys
	      and  signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a sig-
	      nature seems to be older than the key  due  to  clock  problems.
	      This option turns these checks into warnings.


       --homedir dir
	      Set the name of the home directory to dir. If this option is not
	      used, the home directory defaults to  `~/.gnupg'.   It  is  only
	      recognized  when	given  on the command line.  It also overrides
	      any home	directory  stated  through  the  environment  variable
	      `GNUPGHOME'  or  (on  Windows  systems) by means of the Registry
	      entry HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir.

	      On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
	      application.  In this case only this command line option is con-
	      sidered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

	      To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create
	      an  empty  file  name `gpgconf.ctl' in the same directory as the
	      tool `gpgconf.exe'.  The root of the installation is  than  that
	      directory;  or,  if  `gpgconf.exe'  has  been installed directly
	      below a directory named `bin', its parent directory.   You  also
	      need  to	make sure that the following directories exist and are
	      writable:    `ROOT/home'	  for	 the	GnuPG	  home	   and
	      `ROOT/var/cache/gnupg' for internal cache files.



EXAMPLES
       gpgv pgpfile

       gpgv sigfile [datafile]
	      Verify  the  signature  of the file. The second form is used for
	      detached signatures, where sigfile  is  the  detached  signature
	      (either  ASCII-armored  or  binary)  and	datafile  contains the
	      signed data; if datafile is "-" the signed data is  expected  on
	      stdin; if datafile is not given the name of the file holding the
	      signed data is constructed by cutting off the extension (".asc",
	      ".sig" or ".sign") from sigfile.



FILES
       ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg
	      The default keyring with the allowed keys.



ENVIRONMENT
       HOME   Used to locate the default home directory.


       GNUPGHOME
	      If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg".

       The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
       If GnuPG and the info program are properly installed at your site,  the
       command

	 info gnupg

       should  give  you access to the complete manual including a menu struc-
       ture and an index.
