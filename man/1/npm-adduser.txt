NAME
       npm-adduser - Add a registry user account

SYNOPSIS
	 npm adduser [--registry=url] [--scope=@orgname] [--always-auth]

DESCRIPTION
       Create or verify a user named <username> in the specified registry, and
       save the credentials to the .npmrc file. If no registry	is  specified,
       the default registry will be used (see npm help 7 npm-config).

       The username, password, and email are read in from prompts.

       To reset your password, go to https://www.npmjs.com/forgot

       To change your email address, go to https://www.npmjs.com/email-edit

       You  may  use this command multiple times with the same user account to
       authorize on a new machine.  When authenticating on a new machine,  the
       username,  password and email address must all match with your existing
       record.

       npm login is an alias to adduser and behaves exactly the same way.

CONFIGURATION
   registry
       Default: http://registry.npmjs.org/

       The base URL of the npm package registry. If scope is  also  specified,
       this  registry  will only be used for packages with that scope. See npm
       help 7 npm-scope.

   scope
       Default: none

       If specified, the user and login credentials given will	be  associated
       with the specified scope. See npm help 7 npm-scope. You can use both at
       the same time, e.g.

	 npm adduser --registry=http://myregistry.example.com --scope=@myco

       This will set a registry for the given scope and login or create a user
       for that registry at the same time.

   always-auth
       Default: false

       If  specified,  save  configuration indicating that all requests to the
       given registry should include  authorization  information.  Useful  for
       private	registries. Can be used with --registry and / or --scope, e.g.

	 npm adduser --registry=http://private-registry.example.com --always-auth

       This will ensure that all requests to that registry (including for tar-
       balls)  include	an authorization header. See always-auth in npm help 7
       npm-config for more details on always-auth. Registry-specific  configu-
       ration of always-auth takes precedence over any global configuration.
