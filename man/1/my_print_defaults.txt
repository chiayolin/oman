NAME
       my_print_defaults - display options from option files

SYNOPSIS
       my_print_defaults [options] option_group ...

DESCRIPTION
       my_print_defaults displays the options that are present in option
       groups of option files. The output indicates what options will be used
       by programs that read the specified option groups. For example, the
       mysqlcheck program reads the [mysqlcheck] and [client] option groups.
       To see what options are present in those groups in the standard option
       files, invoke my_print_defaults like this:

	   shell> my_print_defaults mysqlcheck client
	   --user=myusername
	   --password=secret
	   --host=localhost

       The output consists of options, one per line, in the form that they
       would be specified on the command line.

       my_print_defaults supports the following options.

       o   --help, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --config-file=file_name, --defaults-file=file_name, -c file_name

	   Read only the given option file.

       o   --debug=debug_options, -# debug_options

	   Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
	   d:t:o,file_name. The default is d:t:o,/tmp/my_print_defaults.trace.

       o   --defaults-extra-file=file_name, --extra-file=file_name, -e
	   file_name

	   Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix)
	   before the user option file.

       o   --defaults-group-suffix=suffix, -g suffix

	   In addition to the groups named on the command line, read groups
	   that have the given suffix.

       o   --login-path=name, -l name

	   Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login
	   path file. A "login path" is an option group that permits only a
	   limited set of options: host, user, and password. Think of a login
	   path as a set of values that indicate the server host and the
	   credentials for authenticating with the server. To create the login
	   path file, use the mysql_config_editor utility. See
	   mysql_config_editor(1). This option was added in MySQL 5.6.6.

       o   --no-defaults, -n

	   Return an empty string.

       o   --show, -s

	   As of MySQL 5.6.25, my_print_defaults masks passwords by defaults.
	   Use this option to display passwords in cleartext.

       o   --verbose, -v

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       o   --version, -V

	   Display version information and exit.
