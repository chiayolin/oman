NAME
       mysql_zap - kill processes that match a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_zap [-signal] [-?Ift] pattern

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_zap kills processes that match a pattern. It uses the ps command
       and Unix signals, so it runs on Unix and Unix-like systems.

       This program is deprecated as of MySQL 5.6.19 and is removed in MySQL
       5.7.

       Invoke mysql_zap like this:

	   shell> mysql_zap [-signal] [-?Ift] pattern

       A process matches if its output line from the ps command contains the
       pattern. By default, mysql_zap asks for confirmation for each process.
       Respond y to kill the process, or q to exit mysql_zap. For any other
       response, mysql_zap does not attempt to kill the process.

       If the -signal option is given, it specifies the name or number of the
       signal to send to each process. Otherwise, mysql_zap tries first with
       TERM (signal 15) and then with KILL (signal 9).

       mysql_zap supports the following additional options:

       o   --help, -?, -I

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   -f

	   Force mode.	mysql_zap attempts to kill each process without
	   confirmation.

       o   -t

	   Test mode. Display information about each process but do not kill
	   it.
