MYSQL_WAITPID(1)	     MySQL Database System	      MYSQL_WAITPID(1)



NAME
       mysql_waitpid - kill process and wait for its termination

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_waitpid [options] pid wait_time

DESCRIPTION
       mysql_waitpid signals a process to terminate and waits for the process
       to exit. It uses the kill() system call and Unix signals, so it runs on
       Unix and Unix-like systems.

       This program is deprecated as of MySQL 5.6.19 and is removed in MySQL
       5.7.

       Invoke mysql_waitpid like this:

	   shell> mysql_waitpid [options] pid wait_time

       mysql_waitpid sends signal 0 to the process identified by pid and waits
       up to wait_time seconds for the process to terminate.  pid and
       wait_time must be positive integers.

       If process termination occurs within the wait time or the process does
       not exist, mysql_waitpid returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 1.

       If the kill() system call cannot handle signal 0, mysql_waitpid() uses
       signal 1 instead.

       mysql_waitpid supports the following options:

       o   --help, -?, -I

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --verbose, -v

	   Verbose mode. Display a warning if signal 0 could not be used and
	   signal 1 is used instead.

       o   --version, -V

	   Display version information and exit.
