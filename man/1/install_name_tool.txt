NAME
       install_name_tool - change dynamic shared library install names

SYNOPSIS
       install_name_tool  [-change  old  new  ]  ...  [-rpath  old  new  ] ...
       [-add_rpath new ] ... [-delete_rpath new ] ... [-id name] file

DESCRIPTION
       Install_name_tool changes the dynamic shared library install names  and
       or  adds,  changes  or  deletes the rpaths recorded in a Mach-O binary.
       For this tool to work when the install names or rpaths are  larger  the
       binary  should  be  built  with	the ld(1) -headerpad_max_install_names
       option.

       -change old new
	      Changes the dependent shared library install name old to new  in
	      the specified Mach-O binary.  More than one of these options can
	      be specified.  If the Mach-O binary does	not  contain  the  old
	      install  name  in  a  specified  -change	option	the  option is
	      ignored.

       -id name
	      Changes the shared library  identification  name	of  a  dynamic
	      shared  library  to name.  If the Mach-O binary is not a dynamic
	      shared library and the -id option is specified it is ignored.

       -rpath old new
	      Changes the rpath path name old to new in the  specified	Mach-O
	      binary.	More  than  one of these options can be specified.  If
	      the Mach-O binary does not contain the old rpath path name in  a
	      specified -rpath it is an error.

       -add_rpath new
	      Adds  the  rpath	path  name new in the specified Mach-O binary.
	      More than one of these options can be specified.	If the	Mach-O
	      binary  already  contains  the  new rpath path name specified in
	      -add_rpath it is an error.

       -delete_rpath old
	      deletes the rpath path name old in the specified Mach-O  binary.
	      More  than one of these options can be specified.  If the Mach-O
	      binary does not contains the old rpath path  name  specified  in
	      -delete_rpath it is an error.
