NAME
       mysqlshow - display database, table, and column information

SYNOPSIS
       mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name [col_name]]]

DESCRIPTION
       The mysqlshow client can be used to quickly see which databases exist,
       their tables, or a table's columns or indexes.

       mysqlshow provides a command-line interface to several SQL SHOW
       statements. See Section 13.7.5, "SHOW Syntax". The same information can
       be obtained by using those statements directly. For example, you can
       issue them from the mysql client program.

       Invoke mysqlshow like this:

	   shell> mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name [col_name]]]

       o   If no database is given, a list of database names is shown.

       o   If no table is given, all matching tables in the database are
	   shown.

       o   If no column is given, all matching columns and column types in the
	   table are shown.

       The output displays only the names of those databases, tables, or
       columns for which you have some privileges.

       If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard characters ("*",
       "?", "%", or "_"), only those names that are matched by the wildcard
       are shown. If a database name contains any underscores, those should be
       escaped with a backslash (some Unix shells require two) to get a list
       of the proper tables or columns.  "*" and "?"  characters are converted
       into SQL "%" and "_" wildcard characters. This might cause some
       confusion when you try to display the columns for a table with a "_" in
       the name, because in this case, mysqlshow shows you only the table
       names that match the pattern. This is easily fixed by adding an extra
       "%" last on the command line as a separate argument.

       mysqlshow supports the following options, which can be specified on the
       command line or in the [mysqlshow] and [client] groups of an option
       file. For information about option files used by MySQL programs, see
       Section 4.2.6, "Using Option Files".

       o   --help, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --bind-address=ip_address

	   On a computer having multiple network interfaces, use this option
	   to select which interface to use for connecting to the MySQL
	   server.

	   This option is supported beginning with MySQL 5.6.1.

       o   --character-sets-dir=path

	   The directory where character sets are installed. See Section 10.5,
	   "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --compress, -C

	   Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
	   both support compression.

       o   --count

	   Show the number of rows per table. This can be slow for non-MyISAM
	   tables.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

	   Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
	   d:t:o,file_name. The default is d:t:o.

       o   --debug-check

	   Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       o   --debug-info

	   Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics
	   when the program exits.

       o   --default-character-set=charset_name

	   Use charset_name as the default character set. See Section 10.5,
	   "Character Set Configuration".

       o   --default-auth=plugin

	   A hint about the client-side authentication plugin to use. See
	   Section 6.3.7, "Pluggable Authentication".

	   This option was added in MySQL 5.6.2.

       o   --defaults-extra-file=file_name

	   Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix)
	   before the user option file. If the file does not exist or is
	   otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
	   relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
	   rather than a full path name.

       o   --defaults-file=file_name

	   Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is
	   otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  file_name is interpreted
	   relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
	   rather than a full path name.

       o   --defaults-group-suffix=str

	   Read not only the usual option groups, but also groups with the
	   usual names and a suffix of str. For example, mysqlshow normally
	   reads the [client] and [mysqlshow] groups. If the
	   --defaults-group-suffix=_other option is given, mysqlshow also
	   reads the [client_other] and [mysqlshow_other] groups.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

	   Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o   --keys, -k

	   Show table indexes.

       o   --login-path=name

	   Read options from the named login path in the .mylogin.cnf login
	   path file. A "login path" is an option group that permits only a
	   limited set of options: host, user, and password. Think of a login
	   path as a set of values that indicate the server host and the
	   credentials for authenticating with the server. To create the login
	   path file, use the mysql_config_editor utility. See
	   mysql_config_editor(1). This option was added in MySQL 5.6.6.

       o   --no-defaults

	   Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to
	   reading unknown options from an option file, --no-defaults can be
	   used to prevent them from being read.

	   The exception is that the .mylogin.cnf file, if it exists, is read
	   in all cases. This permits passwords to be specified in a safer way
	   than on the command line even when --no-defaults is used.
	   (.mylogin.cnf is created by the mysql_config_editor utility. See
	   mysql_config_editor(1).)

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

	   The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
	   short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
	   and the password. If you omit the password value following the
	   --password or -p option on the command line, mysqlshow prompts for
	   one.

	   Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
	   insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
	   Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
	   on the command line.

       o   --pipe, -W

	   On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe. This option
	   applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

       o   --plugin-dir=path

	   The directory in which to look for plugins. It may be necessary to
	   specify this option if the --default-auth option is used to specify
	   an authentication plugin but mysqlshow does not find it. See
	   Section 6.3.7, "Pluggable Authentication".

	   This option was added in MySQL 5.6.2.

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

	   The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       o   --print-defaults

	   Print the program name and all options that it gets from option
	   files.

       o   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

	   The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
	   useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
	   protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the
	   permissible values, see Section 4.2.2, "Connecting to the MySQL
	   Server".

       o   --secure-auth

	   Do not send passwords to the server in old (pre-4.1) format. This
	   prevents connections except for servers that use the newer password
	   format. This option is enabled by default; use --skip-secure-auth
	   to disable it. This option was added in MySQL 5.6.17.

	       Note
	       Passwords that use the pre-4.1 hashing method are less secure
	       than passwords that use the native password hashing method and
	       should be avoided. Pre-4.1 passwords are deprecated and support
	       for them will be removed in a future MySQL release. For account
	       upgrade instructions, see Section 6.3.8.3, "Migrating Away from
	       Pre-4.1 Password Hashing and the mysql_old_password Plugin".

       o   --shared-memory-base-name=name

	   On Windows, the shared-memory name to use, for connections made
	   using shared memory to a local server. The default value is MYSQL.
	   The shared-memory name is case sensitive.

	   The server must be started with the --shared-memory option to
	   enable shared-memory connections.

       o   --show-table-type, -t

	   Show a column indicating the table type, as in SHOW FULL TABLES.
	   The type is BASE TABLE or VIEW.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

	   For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
	   Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       o   --ssl*

	   Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the
	   server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and
	   certificates. See Section 6.3.10.4, "SSL Command Options".

       o   --status, -i

	   Display extra information about each table.

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

	   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --verbose, -v

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
	   This option can be used multiple times to increase the amount of
	   information.

       o   --version, -V

	   Display version information and exit.
