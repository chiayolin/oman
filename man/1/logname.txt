NAME
     logname -- display user's login name

SYNOPSIS
     logname

DESCRIPTION
     The logname utility writes the user's login name to standard output fol-
     lowed by a newline.

     The logname utility explicitly ignores the LOGNAME and USER environment
     variables because the environment cannot be trusted.

     The logname utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
