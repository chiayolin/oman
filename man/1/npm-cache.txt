NAME
       npm-cache - Manipulates packages cache

SYNOPSIS
	 npm cache add <tarball file>
	 npm cache add <folder>
	 npm cache add <tarball url>
	 npm cache add <name>@<version>

	 npm cache ls [<path>]

	 npm cache clean [<path>]

DESCRIPTION
       Used to add, list, or clear the npm cache folder.

       o add:  Add  the specified package to the local cache.  This command is
	 primarily intended to be used internally by npm, but it can provide a
	 way to add data to the local installation cache explicitly.

       o ls:  Show  the  data in the cache.  Argument is a path to show in the
	 cache folder.	Works a bit like the find program, but limited by  the
	 depth config.

       o clean:  Delete  data out of the cache folder.	If an argument is pro-
	 vided, then it specifies a subpath to delete.	If no argument is pro-
	 vided, then the entire cache is cleared.


DETAILS
       npm  stores  cache  data  in  the directory specified in npm config get
       cache.  For each package that is added to the cache,  three  pieces  of
       information are stored in {cache}/{name}/{version}:

       o .../package/package.json: The package.json file, as npm sees it.

       o .../package.tgz: The tarball for that version.


       Additionally,  whenever	a registry request is made, a .cache.json file
       is placed at the corresponding URI, to store the ETag and the requested
       data.  This is stored in {cache}/{hostname}/{path}/.cache.json.

       Commands  that make non-essential registry requests (such as search and
       view, or the completion scripts) generally specify a  minimum  timeout.
       If  the	.cache.json  file  is younger than the specified timeout, then
       they do not make an HTTP request to the registry.

CONFIGURATION

       Default: ~/.npm on Posix, or %AppData%/npm-cache on Windows.
