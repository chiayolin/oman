NAME
     plutil -- property list utility

SYNOPSIS
     plutil [command_option] [other_options] file
	     ...

DESCRIPTION
     plutil can be used to check the syntax of property list files, or convert
     a plist file from one format to another.  Specifying - as an input file
     reads from stdin.

     The first argument indicates the operation to perform, one of:

     -help	   Show the usage information for the command and exit.

     -p 	   Print the property list in a human-readable fashion. The
		   output format is not stable and not designed for machine
		   parsing. The purpose of this command is to be able to eas-
		   ily read the contents of a plist file, no matter what for-
		   mat it is in.

     -lint	   Check the named property list files for syntax errors.
		   This is the default command option if none is specified.

     -convert fmt  Convert the named file to the indicated format and write
		   back to the file system.  If the file can't be loaded due
		   to invalid syntax, the operation fails.

		   fmt is one of:  xml1, for version 1 of the XML plist format
				   binary1, for version 1 of the binary plist
				   format json, for the JSON format

     There are a few additional options:

     -- 	   Specifies that all further arguments are file names

     -s 	   Don't print anything on success.

     -r 	   For JSON, add whitespace and indentation to make the output
		   more human-readable.

     -o path	   Specify an alternate path name for the result of the -con-
		   vert operation; this option is only useful with a single
		   file to be converted.  Specifying - as the path outputs to
		   stdout.

     -e extension  Specify an alternate extension for converted files, and the
		   output file names are otherwise the same.

     The plutil command exits 0 on success, and 1 on failure.
