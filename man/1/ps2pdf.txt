NAME
       ps2pdf - Convert PostScript to PDF using ghostscript
       ps2pdf12  - Convert PostScript to PDF 1.2 (Acrobat 3-and-later compati-
       ble) using ghostscript
       ps2pdf13 - Convert PostScript to PDF 1.3 (Acrobat 4-and-later  compati-
       ble) using ghostscript

SYNOPSIS
       ps2pdf  [options...] {input.[e]ps|-} [output.pdf|-]
       ps2pdf12  [options...] {input.[e]ps|-} [output.pdf|-]
       ps2pdf13  [options...] {input.[e]ps|-} [output.pdf|-]

DESCRIPTION
       The  ps2pdf  scripts  are  work-alikes for nearly all the functionality
       (but not the user interface) of Adobe's Acrobat(TM) Distiller(TM) prod-
       uct:  they  convert  PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF)
       files.

       If the output filename is not specified, the output is placed is a file
       of  the same name with a '.pdf' extension. Either the input filename or
       the output filename can be '-' to request reading from stdin or writing
       to stdout, respectively, when used as a filter.

       The three scripts differ as follows:

       -      ps2pdf12 will always produce PDF 1.2 output (Acrobat 3-and-later
	      compatible).

       -      ps2pdf13 will always produce PDF 1.3 output (Acrobat 4-and-later
	      compatible).

       -      ps2pdf  per se currently produces PDF 1.4 output.  However, this
	      may change in the future. If you care  about  the  compatibility
	      level of the output, use ps2pdf12 or ps2pdf13, or use the -dCom-
	      patibility=1.x switch in the command line.

       There are some limitations in ps2pdf's conversion. See the  HTML  docu-
       mentation  for  more information. A large number of Adobe Distiller(TM)
       parameters which can be used to control the conversion are  also  docu-
       mented  there,  including  instructions	for generating PDF/X and PDF/A
       documents.

OPTIONS
       The ps2pdf scripts use the same options as gs(1).

EXAMPLES
       Converting a figure.ps to figure.pdf:

	      ps2pdf figure.ps

       A conversion with more specifics:

	      ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress figure.ps proof.pdf

       Converting as part of a pipe:

	      make_report.pl -t ps | ps2pdf -dCompatibility=1.3 - - | lpr
