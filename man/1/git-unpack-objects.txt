NAME
       git-unpack-objects - Unpack objects from a packed archive

SYNOPSIS
       git unpack-objects [-n] [-q] [-r] [--strict] < <packfile>


DESCRIPTION
       Read a packed archive (.pack) from the standard input, expanding the
       objects contained within and writing them into the repository in
       "loose" (one object per file) format.

       Objects that already exist in the repository will not be unpacked from
       the packfile. Therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use this
       command on a packfile that exists within the target repository.

       See git-repack(1) for options to generate new packs and replace
       existing ones.

OPTIONS
       -n
	   Dry run. Check the pack file without actually unpacking the
	   objects.

       -q
	   The command usually shows percentage progress. This flag suppresses
	   it.

       -r
	   When unpacking a corrupt packfile, the command dies at the first
	   corruption. This flag tells it to keep going and make the best
	   effort to recover as many objects as possible.

       --strict
	   Don't write objects with broken content or links.
