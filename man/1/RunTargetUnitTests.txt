NAME
     RunTargetUnitTests -- run unit tests for the current target

SYNOPSIS
     RunTargetUnitTests

DESCRIPTION
     RunTargetUnitTests examines its environment and runs the unit tests it
     presumes are present using otest(1).

     RunTargetUnitTests is intended to be called from a shell script build
     phase.  It expects certain environment variables to be configured from
     Xcode build settings (see below).

     RunTargetUnitTests will run tests for all built architectures appropriate
     for the machine running the tests.

ENVIRONMENT
     ARCHS		 The architectures the tests were built for; when
			 tests are run, they will be run once per architec-
			 ture.	If unspecified, tests are run for the archi-
			 tecture returned by arch(1).

     DEVELOPER_DIR	 The Xcode folder, e.g. "/Developer". If unspecified
			 the value for SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_DIR will be used, or
			 "/Developer" if that also is unspecified.

     BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR  The directory containing built products; when tests
			 are run, this is specified in DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH.
			 If unspecified tests are run from the current working
			 directory with no DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH.

     FULL_PRODUCT_NAME	 The full name of the built product, including its
			 wrapper extension if any.

     GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_GC  Whether or not the test bundle was compiled with
			 Objective-C garbage collection enabled.  Possible
			 values are unsupported, supported, and required.  If
			 not set, defaults to unsupported, which will run
			 otest(1) with Objective-C garbage collection dis-
			 abled.

     NATIVE_ARCH_ACTUAL  The architecture of the machine running the tests,
			 used to determine for which architectures tests can
			 be run.  If unspecified, defaults to the architecture
			 returned by arch(1).

     OTEST		 The path to the otest command line tool; defaults to
			 /Developer/Tools/otest.

     TEST_AFTER_BUILD	 Set to YES to run tests, any other value will prevent
			 test execution.

FILES
     /Developer/Tools/RunTargetUnitTests  The script used to run tests from a
					  shell script build phase.

     /Developer/Tools/otest		  The OCUnit test rig.
