NAME
       gpg-error-config  -  Script to get information about the installed ver-
       sion of libgpg-error

SYNOPSIS
       gpg-error-config [options]


DESCRIPTION
       gpg-error-config is a tool that is used to configure to	determine  the
       compiler  and linker flags that should be used to compile and link pro-
       grams that use Libgpg-error. It is also	used  internally  to  the  .m4
       macros for GNU autoconf that are included with Libgpg-error.


OPTIONS
       gpg-error-config accepts the following options:



       --mt   Provide  output appropriate for multithreaded programs.  --mt is
	      only useful when combined with other options, and  must  be  the
	      first option if present.


       --version
	      Print  the  currently  installed	version of Libgpg-error on the
	      standard output.


       --libs Print the linker flags that are  necessary  to  link  a  program
	      using Libgpg-error.


       --cflags
	      Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program
	      using Libgpg-error.


       --prefix=prefix
	      If specified, use prefix instead of the installation prefix that
	      Libgpg-error  was  built	with when computing the output for the
	      --cflags and --libs options.  This option is also used  for  the
	      exec  prefix  if	--exec-prefix  was not specified.  This option
	      must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.


       --exec-prefix=prefix
	      If specified, use prefix instead of the installation exec prefix
	      that  Libgpg-error  was built with when computing the output for
	      the --cflags and --libs options.	This option must be  specified
	      before any --libs or --cflags options.
