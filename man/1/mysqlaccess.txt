NAME
       mysqlaccess - client for checking access privileges

SYNOPSIS
       mysqlaccess [host_name [user_name [db_name]]] [options]

DESCRIPTION
	   Note
	   This utility is deprecated in MySQL 5.6.17 and removed in MySQL 5.7

       mysqlaccess is a diagnostic tool that Yves Carlier has provided for the
       MySQL distribution. It checks the access privileges for a host name,
       user name, and database combination. Note that mysqlaccess checks
       access using only the user and db tables. It does not check table,
       column, or routine privileges specified in the tables_priv,
       columns_priv, or procs_priv tables.

       Invoke mysqlaccess like this:

	   shell> mysqlaccess [host_name [user_name [db_name]]] [options]

       mysqlaccess supports the following options.

       o   --help, -?

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --brief, -b

	   Generate reports in single-line tabular format.

       o   --commit

	   Copy the new access privileges from the temporary tables to the
	   original grant tables. The grant tables must be flushed for the new
	   privileges to take effect. (For example, execute a mysqladmin
	   reload command.)

       o   --copy

	   Reload the temporary grant tables from original ones.

       o   --db=db_name, -d db_name

	   Specify the database name.

       o   --debug=N

	   Specify the debug level.  N can be an integer from 0 to 3.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

	   The host name to use in the access privileges.

       o   --howto

	   Display some examples that show how to use mysqlaccess.

       o   --old_server

	   Assume that the server is an old MySQL server (before MySQL 3.21)
	   that does not yet know how to handle full WHERE clauses.

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

	   The password to use when connecting to the server. If you omit the
	   password value following the --password or -p option on the command
	   line, mysqlaccess prompts for one.

	   Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
	   insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
	   Security".

       o   --plan

	   Display suggestions and ideas for future releases.

       o   --preview

	   Show the privilege differences after making changes to the
	   temporary grant tables.

       o   --relnotes

	   Display the release notes.

       o   --rhost=host_name, -H host_name

	   Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       o   --rollback

	   Undo the most recent changes to the temporary grant tables.

       o   --spassword[=password], -P[password]

	   The password to use when connecting to the server as the superuser.
	   If you omit the password value following the --spassword or -p
	   option on the command line, mysqlaccess prompts for one.

	   Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
	   insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
	   Security".

       o   --superuser=user_name, -U user_name

	   Specify the user name for connecting as the superuser.

       o   --table, -t

	   Generate reports in table format.

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

	   The user name to use in the access privileges.

       o   --version, -v

	   Display version information and exit.

       If your MySQL distribution is installed in some nonstandard location,
       you must change the location where mysqlaccess expects to find the
       mysql client. Edit the mysqlaccess script at approximately line 18.
       Search for a line that looks like this:

	   $MYSQL     = '/usr/local/bin/mysql';    # path to mysql executable

       Change the path to reflect the location where mysql actually is stored
       on your system. If you do not do this, a Broken pipe error will occur
       when you run mysqlaccess.
