NAME
       RezDet - Resource Detective (DEPRECATED)

SYNOPSIS
       RezDet resourceFile1 [resourceFile2]... [-b[ig]] [-useDF] [-noResolve]
       [-d[ump] | -l[ist] | -q[uiet] | -r[awdump] | -s[how] | -t[erse]]


DESCRIPTION
       Tools supporting Carbon development, including RezDet, were deprecated
       with Xcode 6.

       RezDet tool investigates the resource fork of the specified files for
       damage or inconsistencies. Files are read and checked one at a time,
       and messages are generated for each error, indicating the cause of the
       damage.	In determining the source of the errors, RezDet checks that
       the files meet the following conditions:

       - The resource fork contains the minimum number of bytes (enough to
       read a resource header).

       - The header, resource data list, and resource map do not overlap or
       contain spaces between them. There should not be any bytes between the
       end-of-file marker and the end of the resource map.

       - Each record in the resource data list is used once and only once and
       the last data item ends exactly where the data list ends.

       - Each item in the resource type list contains at least one reference;
       each sequence of referenced items starts where the reference list for
       the previous resource type item ends; and each item in the reference
       list is pointed to by one and only one resource type list item.

       - The resource type list does not contain any duplicates.

       - Each name in the name list has one and only one reference, and the
       last name does not point outside the name list.

       - All names have a nonzero length.

       - The name list does not contain any duplicates. Note that duplicate
       names cause an advisory warning rather than a true error and that
       RezDet does not generate this warning unless you also specify the -d,
       -r, or -s options.

       - Each reference list item points to a valid data item and either has a
       name list offset of -1 or points to a valid name list offset.

       - Bits 7 (reserved) and 1 (changed) are not set in the resource
       attributes.

       Note:  RezDet does not use the Resource Manager and should not crash no
	      matter how corrupt the resource fork of a file is.


INPUT
       One or more files (resourceFile). The RezDet tool does not read
       standard input.


OUTPUT
       Standard output.  RezDet writes error messages to diagnostic output. If
       you specify -d, -l, -r, -s, or -t, the information produced by that
       option is written to standard output.  Note: For the options in which
       additional information is retrieved, fields are displayed as
       hexadecimal or decimal numbers for numeric values, or as a hex dump
       with associated printable Macintosh characters.


STATUS
       RezDet can return the following status codes:

       0  no errors
       1  syntax error (invalid options or no files specified)
       2  resource format error
       3  fatal error--an I/O or program error


PARAMETERS
       resourceFile1 [ resourceFile2 ] ...
	      Specifies one or more resource files to be checked.



OPTIONS
       -b[ig] Reads the data for each resource into memory one resource at a
	      time, instead of all at once.  This is useful for checking huge
	      resource files, such as the System file.

	      Note: Try using this option if RezDet tells you that it ran out
	      of memory or that memory is badly fragmented.

       -useDF Reads and writes resource information from the files' data
	      forks, instead of their resource forks.

       -noResolve
	      Prevents the resolution of leaf aliases in the input resource
	      file path. This allows the resources in a Finder alias file to
	      be checked.

       -d[ump]
	      Generates the same information as the -s[how] option as well as
	      detailed information about the resource header, type list, name
	      list, resource map, and data list.

       -l[ist]
	      Lists resource types, IDs, names, attributes, and resource
	      sizes. Output appears in the following format: 'type' (ID, name,
	      attributes) [size]

       -q[uiet]
	      Returns a status code instead of generating error messages.

       -r[awdump]
	      Generates the same information as the -d[ump] option but also
	      dumps the contents of data blocks.

	      Note: This option can generate huge amounts of output.

       -s[how]
	      Writes information about individual resource types. For each
	      type, RezDet provides the following information: the number of
	      items of this type, the reference list offset, and detailed
	      information on each ID (including the resource name, if any,
	      resource attributes, data offset, and data length).

       -t[erse]
	      Suppresses all messages that do not explicitly describe errors.
	      Examples of such messages include the name of the current file
	      and the statement that the file is OK in the event that no
	      errors were found. Similar to the -q option, but allows error
	      messages to display.


EXAMPLES
       The following command line checks the System file.

       RezDet "{SystemFolder}System" -big

       If the file is damaged, RezDet returns an error message such as this
       one:

       File "HD:System Folder:System"; ### RezDet -- Data inconsistency, 36
       bytes left over.

       The following command line removes the Test.c file if its resource fork
       is damaged.

       RezDet Test.c -q || Delete Test.c


LIMITATIONS
       The RezDet tool does not validate the file attributes field in the
       resource map header and ignores the Finder-specific fields in the
       header and resource map header.

       Duplicate resource name warnings are generated when you specify -d, -r,
       or -s, even if the names belong to resources of different types.
