NAME
       fc-cache - build font information cache files

SYNOPSIS
       fc-cache  [ -frsvVh ]  [ --force ]  [ --really-force ]  [ --system-only
       ]  [ --verbose ]  [ --version ]	[ --help ]  [ dir... ]

DESCRIPTION
       fc-cache scans the font directories  on	the  system  and  builds  font
       information  cache  files  for  applications using fontconfig for their
       font handling.

       If directory arguments are not given, fc-cache uses each  directory  in
       the  current  font  configuration.  Each  directory is scanned for font
       files readable by FreeType. A cache is created which  contains  proper-
       ties  of  each font and the associated filename.  This cache is used to
       speed up application startup when using the fontconfig library.

       Note that fc-cache must be executed once per architecture  to  generate
       font information customized for that architecture.

OPTIONS
       This  program  follows  the  usual  GNU	command line syntax, with long
       options starting with  two  dashes  (`-').  A  summary  of  options  is
       included below.

       -f     Force  re-generation of apparently up-to-date cache files, over-
	      riding the timestamp checking.

       -r     Erase all existing cache files and rescan.

       -s     Only scan system-wide directories, omitting the  places  located
	      in the user's home directory.

       -v     Display status information while busy.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -V     Show version of the program and exit.

       dir    Directory to scan for fonts.

FILES
       %cachdir%/*-%arch%.cache-2
	      These files are generated by fc-cache and contain maps from file
	      names to font  properties.  They	are  read  by  the  fontconfig
	      library at application startup to locate appropriate fonts.
