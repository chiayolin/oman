NAME
       npm-prune - Remove extraneous packages

SYNOPSIS
	 npm prune [<name> [<name ...]]
	 npm prune [<name> [<name ...]] [--production]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command removes "extraneous" packages.  If a package name is pro-
       vided, then only packages  matching  one  of  the  supplied  names  are
       removed.

       Extraneous  packages  are  packages  that  are not listed on the parent
       package's dependencies list.

       If the --production flag is specified or the NODE_ENV environment vari-
       able is set to production, this command will remove the packages speci-
       fied in your devDependencies. Setting  --production=false  will	negate
       NODE_ENV being set to production.
