NAME
       gnuplot - an interactive plotting program

SYNOPSIS
       gnuplot [X11 options] [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Gnuplot is a command-driven interactive plotting program.

       If file names are given on the command line, gnuplot loads and executes
       each file in the order specified, and exits after the last file is pro-
       cessed.	 If  no  files are given, gnuplot prompts for interactive com-
       mands.

       Here are some of its features:

       Plots any number of functions, built up of C operators, C math  library
       functions, and some things C doesn't have like **, sgn(), etc.

       User-defined constants and functions.

       All  computations  performed in the complex domain.  Just the real part
       is plotted by default, but functions like imag() and  abs()  and  arg()
       are available to override this.

       Many  presentation  styles for plotting user data from files, including
       surface-fitting, error bars, boxplots, histograms, heat maps, and  sim-
       ple manipulation of image data.	There is an on-line demo collection at
       http://gnuplot.info/demo

       Nonlinear least-squares fitting.

       2D and 3D plots with mouse-controlled zooming, rotation, and hypertext.

       Shell escapes and command line substitution.

       Load and save capability.

       Support for a huge variety of output devices and file formats.

OPTIONS
       -p,  --persist  lets  plot  windows  survive after main gnuplot program
       exits.

       -c scriptname ARG1 ARG2 ..., load script using gnuplot's "call"	mecha-
       nism and pass it the remainder of the command line as arguments

       -d,  --default  settings.   Do not read from gnuplotrc or ~/.gnuplot on
       entry.

       -e "command list" executes the requested commands  before  loading  the
       next input file.

       -h, --help print summary of usage

       -V show current version

X11 OPTIONS
       For  terminal  type x11, gnuplot accepts the standard X Toolkit options
       and resources such as geometry, font, and background. See the X(1)  man
       page  for  a  description  of common options.  For additional X options
       specific to gnuplot, type help x11 on the gnuplot command  line.  These
       options have no effect on other terminal types.

ENVIRONMENT
       A  number  of  shell  environment  variables are understood by gnuplot.
       None of these are required.

       GNUTERM
	      The name of the terminal type to be used by default.   This  can
	      be  overridden  by the gnuplotrc or .gnuplot start-up files and,
	      of course, by later explicit "set terminal" commands.

       GNUHELP
	      The pathname of the HELP file (gnuplot.gih).

       HOME   The name of a directory to search for a .gnuplot file.

       PAGER  An output filter for help messages.

       SHELL  The program used for the "shell" command.

       FIT_SCRIPT
	      Specifies a gnuplot command to be executed when a fit is	inter-
	      rupted---see "help fit".

       FIT_LOG
	      The name of the logfile maintained by fit.

       GNUPLOT_LIB
	      Additional  search  directories  for data and command files. The
	      variable may contain a single  directory	name,  or  a  list  of
	      directories  separated  by  ':'. The contents of GNUPLOT_LIB are
	      appended to the "loadpath" variable,  but  not  saved  with  the
	      "save" and "save set" commands.

       GDFONTPATH
	      Several  gnuplot	terminal drivers access TrueType fonts via the
	      gd library.  This variable gives the font search path for  these
	      drivers.

       GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT
	      The  default  font for the terminal drivers that access TrueType
	      fonts via the gd library.

       GNUPLOT_FONTPATH
	      The font search path used by the postscript terminal. The format
	      is the same as for GNUPLOT_LIB. The contents of GNUPLOT_FONTPATH
	      are appended to the "fontpath" variable, but not saved with  the
	      "save" and "save set" commands.

       GNUPLOT_PS_DIR
	      Used by the postscript driver to locate external prologue files.
	      Depending on  the  build	process,  gnuplot  contains  either  a
	      builtin  copy of those files or simply a default hardcoded path.
	      Use this variable to test the postscript	terminal  with	custom
	      prologue files. See "help postscript prologue".

FILES
       gnuplotrc
	      When  gnuplot  is run, it first looks for a system-wide initial-
	      ization file named gnuplotrc.  The  standard  location  of  this
	      file  expected by the program is reported by the "show loadpath"
	      command.

       .gnuplot
	      After loading the system-wide initialization file, if any,  Gnu-
	      plot  looks for a private initialization file in the HOME direc-
	      tory.  It may contain any legal gnuplot commands, but  typically
	      they  are  limited  to  setting  the preferred terminal and line
	      types and defining frequently-used functions or variables.

       fit.log
	      The default name of the logfile output by the "fit" command.
