NAME
       npm-search - Search for packages

SYNOPSIS
	 npm search [--long] [search terms ...]
	 npm s [search terms ...]
	 npm se [search terms ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Search the registry for packages matching the search terms.

       If a term starts with /, then it's interpreted as a regular expression.
       A trailing / will be ignored in this case.   (Note  that  many  regular
       expression characters must be escaped or quoted in most shells.)

CONFIGURATION
   long
       o Default: false

       o Type: Boolean


       Display	full  package descriptions and other long text across multiple
       lines. When disabled (default) search  results  are  truncated  to  fit
       neatly on a single line. Modules with extremely long names will fall on
       multiple lines.
