NAME
       gamma4scanimage - create a gamma table for scanimage

SYNOPSIS
       gamma4scanimage gamma [shadow [highlight [maxin [maxout]]]]


DESCRIPTION
       The  tool  gamma4scanimage creates a gamma table in the format expected
       by scanimage. You can define a gamma, a shadow and a  highlight	value.
       You also can specify the size (maxin) and maximum output value (maxout)
       of the gamma table.

       gamma is a floating point value, neutral value is 1.0, if the value  is
       larger than 1.0 then the image gets brighter.

       shadow  defines	the minimum input value that is necessary to create an
       output value  larger  than  zero.   shadow  has	to  be	in  the  range
       [0..maxin]. Its default value is 0.

       highlight defines the maximum input value that produces an output value
       smaller than maxout.  highlight has to  be  in  the  range  [0..maxin],
       highlight  has  to be larger than shadow. Its default value is the same
       as maxin (16383 if not set).

       maxin defines the size of the gamma table.  The	size  depends  on  the
       scanner/backend.  If the scanner uses 8 bits gamma input then maxin has
       to be set to 255, for 10 bits 1023, for	12  bits  4095,  for  14  bits
       16383.  The  default  is 16383.	To find out what value maxin has to be
       call scanimage with a very large gamma table [0]0-[99999]255 then scan-
       image  prints an error message with the needed size of the gamma table.

       maxout defines the maximum output value. Take a look at the  output  of
       scanimage  -h  to  find out what maxout has to be. The default value is
       255.


EXAMPLE
       scanimage --custom-gamma=yes --gamma-table `gamma4scanimage 1.8 0 11500
       16383 255` >image.pnm
