NAME
       metaflac  -  program  to  list, add, remove, or edit metadata in one or
       more FLAC files.

SYNOPSIS
       metaflac [ options ] [ operations ] FLACfile ...


DESCRIPTION
       Use metaflac to list, add, remove, or edit metadata in one or more FLAC
       files.	You  may perform one major operation, or many shorthand opera-
       tions at a time.

OPTIONS
       --preserve-modtime
	      Preserve the original modification time in spite of edits.

       --with-filename
	      Prefix each output line with the FLAC file name (the default  if
	      more than one FLAC file is specified).

       --no-filename
	      Do  not  prefix  each  output  line with the FLAC file name (the
	      default if only one FLAC file is specified).

       --no-utf8-convert
	      Do not convert tags from UTF-8 to local charset, or vice	versa.
	      This is useful for scripts, and setting tags in situations where
	      the locale is wrong.

       --dont-use-padding
	      By default metaflac tries to use padding where possible to avoid
	      rewriting  the  entire  file  if the metadata size changes.  Use
	      this option to tell metaflac to not take	advantage  of  padding
	      this way.

SHORTHAND OPERATIONS
       --show-md5sum
	      Show the MD5 signature from the STREAMINFO block.

       --show-min-blocksize
	      Show the minimum block size from the STREAMINFO block.

       --show-max-blocksize
	      Show the maximum block size from the STREAMINFO block.

       --show-min-framesize
	      Show the minimum frame size from the STREAMINFO block.

       --show-max-framesize
	      Show the maximum frame size from the STREAMINFO block.

       --show-sample-rate
	      Show the sample rate from the STREAMINFO block.

       --show-channels
	      Show the number of channels from the STREAMINFO block.

       --show-bps
	      Show the # of bits per sample from the STREAMINFO block.

       --show-total-samples
	      Show the total # of samples from the STREAMINFO block.

       --show-vendor-tag
	      Show the vendor string from the VORBIS_COMMENT block.

       --show-tag=name
	      Show all tags where the the field name matches 'name'.

       --remove-tag=name
	      Remove all tags whose field name is 'name'.

       --remove-first-tag=name
	      Remove first tag whose field name is 'name'.

       --remove-all-tags
	      Remove all tags, leaving only the vendor string.

       --set-tag=field
	      Add  a tag.  The field must comply with the Vorbis comment spec,
	      of the form "NAME=VALUE".  If there is currently no  tag	block,
	      one will be created.

       --set-tag-from-file=field
	      Like  --set-tag,	except	the VALUE is a filename whose contents
	      will be read verbatim  to  set  the  tag	value.	 Unless  --no-
	      utf8-convert  is	specified,  the  contents will be converted to
	      UTF-8 from the local charset.  This  can	be  used  to  store  a
	      cuesheet	    in	    a	   tag	    (e.g.      --set-tag-from-
	      file="CUESHEET=image.cue").  Do not try to store binary data  in
	      tag fields!  Use APPLICATION blocks for that.

       --import-tags-from=file
	      Import  tags  from a file.  Use '-' for stdin.  Each line should
	      be of the form NAME=VALUE.  Multi-line  comments	are  currently
	      not  supported.  Specify --remove-all-tags and/or --no-utf8-con-
	      vert before --import-tags-from if necessary.   If  FILE  is  '-'
	      (stdin), only one FLAC file may be specified.

       --export-tags-to=file
	      Export  tags  to a file.	Use '-' for stdout.  Each line will be
	      of the form NAME=VALUE.  Specify --no-utf8-convert if necessary.

       --import-cuesheet-from=file
	      Import  a  cuesheet  from  a file.  Use '-' for stdin.  Only one
	      FLAC file may be specified.  A seekpoint will be added for  each
	      index  point  in the cuesheet to the SEEKTABLE unless --no-cued-
	      seekpoints is specified.

       --export-cuesheet-to=file
	      Export CUESHEET block to a cuesheet file, suitable for use by CD
	      authoring software.  Use '-' for stdout.	Only one FLAC file may
	      be specified on the command line.

       --import-picture-from={FILENAME|SPECIFICATION}
	      Import a picture and store it in a PICTURE metadata block.  More
	      than one --import-picture-from command can be specified.	Either
	      a filename for the picture file or a more complete specification
	      form can be used.  The SPECIFICATION is a string whose parts are
	      separated by | (pipe) characters.  Some parts may be left  empty
	      to  invoke  default  values.   FILENAME  is  just  shorthand for
	      "||||FILENAME".  The format of SPECIFICATION is

	      [TYPE]|[MIME-TYPE]|[DESCRIPTION]|[WIDTHxHEIGHTxDEPTH[/COL-
	      ORS]]|FILE

	      TYPE is optional; it is a number from one of:

	      0: Other

	      1: 32x32 pixels 'file icon' (PNG only)

	      2: Other file icon

	      3: Cover (front)

	      4: Cover (back)

	      5: Leaflet page

	      6: Media (e.g. label side of CD)

	      7: Lead artist/lead performer/soloist

	      8: Artist/performer

	      9: Conductor

	      10: Band/Orchestra

	      11: Composer

	      12: Lyricist/text writer

	      13: Recording Location

	      14: During recording

	      15: During performance

	      16: Movie/video screen capture

	      17: A bright coloured fish

	      18: Illustration

	      19: Band/artist logotype

	      20: Publisher/Studio logotype

	      The  default  is 3 (front cover).  There may only be one picture
	      each of type 1 and 2 in a file.

	      MIME-TYPE is optional; if left blank, it will be	detected  from
	      the  file.   For	best  compatibility with players, use pictures
	      with MIME type image/jpeg or image/png.  The MIME type can  also
	      be  -->  to mean that FILE is actually a URL to an image, though
	      this use is discouraged.

	      DESCRIPTION is optional; the default is an empty string.

	      The next part specfies the resolution and color information.  If
	      the  MIME-TYPE  is  image/jpeg, image/png, or image/gif, you can
	      usually leave this empty and they can be detected from the file.
	      Otherwise,  you must specify the width in pixels, height in pix-
	      els, and color  depth  in  bits-per-pixel.   If  the  image  has
	      indexed  colors  you  should  also  specify the number of colors
	      used.  When manually specified, it is not  checked  against  the
	      file for accuracy.

	      FILE  is the path to the picture file to be imported, or the URL
	      if MIME type is -->

	      For example, "|image/jpeg|||../cover.jpg" will  embed  the  JPEG
	      file  at ../cover.jpg, defaulting to type 3 (front cover) and an
	      empty description.   The	resolution  and  color	info  will  be
	      retrieved from the file itself.

	      The						 specification
	      "4|-->|CD|320x300x24/173|http://blah.blah/backcover.tiff"   will
	      embed the given URL, with type 4 (back cover), description "CD",
	      and a manually specified resolution  of  320x300,  24  bits-per-
	      pixel, and 173 colors.  The file at the URL will not be fetched;
	      the URL itself is stored in the PICTURE metadata block.

       --export-picture-to=file
	      Export PICTURE block to a file.  Use '-' for stdout.   Only  one
	      FLAC  file may be specified on the command line.	The first PIC-
	      TURE block will be exported unless --export-picture-to  is  pre-
	      ceded by a --block-number=# option to specify the exact metadata
	      block to extract.  Note that the block number is the  one  shown
	      by --list.

       --add-replay-gain
	      Calculates  the  title  and  album gains/peaks of the given FLAC
	      files as if all the files were part of one  album,  then	stores
	      them  as FLAC tags.  The tags are the same as those used by vor-
	      bisgain.	Existing ReplayGain tags will be  replaced.   If  only
	      one  FLAC  file  is given, the album and title gains will be the
	      same.  Since this operation requires two passes,	it  is	always
	      executed	last,  after  all other operations have been completed
	      and written to disk.  All FLAC files  specified  must  have  the
	      same  resolution, sample rate, and number of channels.  The sam-
	      ple rate must be one of 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 18.9, 22.05, 24,  28,
	      32,  37.8,  44.1, 48, 56, 64, 88.2, 96, 112, 128, 144, 176.4, or
	      192kHz.

       --remove-replay-gain
	      Removes the ReplayGain tags.

       --add-seekpoint={#|X|#x|#s}
	      Add seek points to a SEEKTABLE block.  Using #, a seek point  at
	      that  sample  number  is added.  Using X, a placeholder point is
	      added at the end of a the table.	Using #x, # evenly spaced seek
	      points  will be added, the first being at sample 0.  Using #s, a
	      seekpoint will be added every # seconds (# does not have to be a
	      whole  number;  it can be, for example, 9.5, meaning a seekpoint
	      every 9.5 seconds).  If no SEEKTABLE block exists, one  will  be
	      created.	 If  one  already  exists, points will be added to the
	      existing table, and any duplicates will be  turned  into	place-
	      holder  points.	You  may use many --add-seekpoint options; the
	      resulting SEEKTABLE will be the unique-ified union of  all  such
	      values.  Example: --add-seekpoint=100x --add-seekpoint=3.5s will
	      add 100 evenly spaced seekpoints and a seekpoint every 3.5  sec-
	      onds.

       --add-padding=length
	      Add a padding block of the given length (in bytes).  The overall
	      length of the new block will be 4 + length; the extra 4 bytes is
	      for the metadata block header.

MAJOR OPERATIONS
       --list List  the contents of one or more metadata blocks to stdout.  By
	      default, all metadata blocks are listed in text format.  Use the
	      following options to change this behavior:

	      --block-number=#[,#[...]]
		     An optional comma-separated list of block numbers to dis-
		     play.  The first block, the STREAMINFO block, is block 0.

	      --block-type=type[,type[...]]

	      --except-block-type=type[,type[...]]
		     An  optional  comma-separated  list  of block types to be
		     included or ignored with this option.  Use  only  one  of
		     --block-type  or  --except-block-type.   The  valid block
		     types are: STREAMINFO, PADDING,  APPLICATION,  SEEKTABLE,
		     VORBIS_COMMENT,  PICTURE.	 You may narrow down the types
		     of APPLICATION blocks displayed as follows:

		     APPLICATION:abcd	     The  APPLICATION  block(s)  whose
		     textual  repre-  sentation  of  the  4-byte  ID is "abcd"
		     APPLICATION:0xXXXXXXXX  The  APPLICATION  block(s)  whose
		     hexadecimal  big-	endian representation of the 4-byte ID
		     is "0xXXXXXXXX".  For the example "abcd" above the  hexa-
		     decimal equivalalent is 0x61626364

		     Note:  if	both  --block-number and --[except-]block-type
		     are specified, the result is  the	logical  AND  of  both
		     arguments.

	      --application-data-format=hexdump|text
		     If  the  application  block  you  are displaying contains
		     binary data but your --data-format=text, you can  display
		     a hex dump of the application data contents instead using
		     --application-data-format=hexdump.

       --remove
	      Remove one or more metadata blocks from  the  metadata.	Unless
	      --dont-use-padding  is  specified,  the  blocks will be replaced
	      with padding.  You may not remove the STREAMINFO block.

	      --block-number=#[,#[...]]

	      --block-type=type[,type[...]]

	      --except-block-type=type[,type[...]]
		     See --list above for usage.

		     Note: if both  --block-number  and  --[except-]block-type
		     are  specified,  the  result  is  the logical AND of both
		     arguments.

       --remove-all
	      Remove all metadata blocks (except the  STREAMINFO  block)  from
	      the  metadata.   Unless  --dont-use-padding  is  specified,  the
	      blocks will be replaced with padding.

       --merge-padding
	      Merge adjacent PADDING blocks into single blocks.

       --sort-padding
	      Move all PADDING blocks to the end of  the  metadata  and  merge
	      them into a single block.
