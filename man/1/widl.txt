NAME
       widl - Wine Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiler

SYNOPSIS
       widl [options] IDL_file
       widl [options] --dlldata-only name1 [name2...]

DESCRIPTION
       When  no  options are used the program will generate a header file, and
       possibly client and server stubs, proxy and dlldata files,  a  typelib,
       and  a UUID file, depending on the contents of the IDL file.  If any of
       the options -c, -h, -p, -s, -t, -u or --local-stubs is given, widl will
       only generate the requested files, and no others.  When run with --dll-
       data-only, widl will only generate a dlldata file, and it will  contain
       a  list of the names passed as arguments.  Usually the way this file is
       updated is that each time widl is run, it reads	any  existing  dlldata
       file,  and if necessary regenerates it with the same list of names, but
       with the present proxy file included.

       When run without any arguments, widl will print a help message.


OPTIONS
       General options:

       -V     Print version number and exit.

       -o, --output=name
	      Set the name of the output file. When generating multiple output
	      files,  this sets only the base name of the file; the respective
	      output files are then named name.h, name_p.c, etc.

       -b cpu-manufacturer[-kernel]-os
	      Set the target architecture  when  cross-compiling.  The	target
	      specification  is in the standard autoconf format as returned by
	      config.sub.

       Header options:

       -h     Generate header files. The default output filename is  infile.h.

       --oldnames
	      Use old naming conventions.

       Type library options:

       -t     Generate	 a  type  library.  The  default  output  filename  is
	      infile.tlb.  If the output file name  ends  in  .res,  a	binary
	      resource	file containing the type library is generated instead.

       -m32, -m64
	      Generate a Win32 or Win64 type library respectively.

       UUID file options:

       -u     Generate a UUID file. The default output filename is infile_i.c.

       Proxy/stub generation options:

       -c     Generate	a  client  stub  file.	The default output filename is
	      infile_c.c.

       -Os    Generate inline stubs.

       -Oi    Generate old-style interpreted stubs.

       -Oif, -Oic, -Oicf
	      Generate new-style fully interpreted stubs.

       -p     Generate a proxy. The default output filename is infile_p.c.

       --prefix-all=prefix
	      Prefix to put on the name of both client and server stubs.

       --prefix-client=prefix
	      Prefix to put on the name of client stubs.

       --prefix-server=prefix
	      Prefix to put on the name of server stubs.

       -s     Generate a server stub file.  The  default  output  filename  is
	      infile_s.c.

       --win32, --win64
	      Only generate 32-bit or 64-bit code respectively (the default is
	      to generate both 32-bit and 64-bit versions into the same desti-
	      nation file).

       Registration script options:

       -r     Generate	a  registration script. The default output filename is
	      infile_r.rgs. If the output file name ends  in  .res,  a	binary
	      resource file containing the script is generated instead.

       Dlldata file options:

       --dlldata-only name1 [name2...]
	      Regenerate  the  dlldata	file  from scratch using the specified
	      proxy names. The default output filename is dlldata.c.

       Preprocessor options:

       -I path
	      Add a header search directory to path. Multiple search  directo-
	      ries are allowed.

       -D id[=val]
	      Define preprocessor macro id with value val.

       -E     Preprocess only.

       -N     Do not preprocess input.

       Debug options:

       -W     Enable pedantic warnings.

       -d n   Set debug level to the non negative integer n.  If prefixed with
	      0x, it will be interpreted as an hexadecimal  number.   For  the
	      meaning of values, see the DEBUG section.

       Miscellaneous options:

       -app_config
	      Ignored, present for midl compatibility.

       --local-stubs=file
	      Generate	empty  stubs  for  call_as/local  methods in an object
	      interface and write them to file.


DEBUG
       Debug level n is a bitmask with the following meaning:
	   * 0x01 Tell which resource is parsed (verbose mode)
	   * 0x02 Dump internal structures
	   * 0x04 Create a parser trace (yydebug=1)
	   * 0x08 Preprocessor messages
	   * 0x10 Preprocessor lex messages
	   * 0x20 Preprocessor yacc trace
