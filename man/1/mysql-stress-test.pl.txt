NAME
       mysql-stress-test.pl - server stress test program

SYNOPSIS
       mysql-stress-test.pl [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The mysql-stress-test.pl Perl script performs stress-testing of the
       MySQL server.

       mysql-stress-test.pl requires a version of Perl that has been built
       with threads support.

       Invoke mysql-stress-test.pl like this:

	   shell> mysql-stress-test.pl [options]

       mysql-stress-test.pl supports the following options:

       o   --help

	   Display a help message and exit.

       o   --abort-on-error=N

	   Causes the program to abort if an error with severity less than or
	   equal to N was encountered. Set to 1 to abort on any error.

       o   --check-tests-file

	   Periodically check the file that lists the tests to be run. If it
	   has been modified, reread the file. This can be useful if you
	   update the list of tests to be run during a stress test.

       o   --cleanup

	   Force cleanup of the working directory.

       o   --log-error-details

	   Log error details in the global error log file.

       o   --loop-count=N

	   In sequential test mode, the number of loops to execute before
	   exiting.

       o   --mysqltest=path

	   The path name to the mysqltest program.

       o   --server-database=db_name

	   The database to use for the tests. The default is test.

       o   --server-host=host_name

	   The host name of the local host to use for making a TCP/IP
	   connection to the local server. By default, the connection is made
	   to localhost using a Unix socket file.

       o   --server-logs-dir=path

	   This option is required.  path is the directory where all client
	   session logs will be stored. Usually this is the shared directory
	   that is associated with the server used for testing.

       o   --server-password=password

	   The password to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --server-port=port_num

	   The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to the server. The
	   default is 3306.

       o   --server-socket=file_name

	   For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
	   Windows, the name of the named pipe to use. The default if
	   /tmp/mysql.sock.

       o   --server-user=user_name

	   The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The
	   default is root.

       o   --sleep-time=N

	   The delay in seconds between test executions.

       o   --stress-basedir=path

	   This option is required.  path is the working directory for the
	   test run. It is used as the temporary location for result tracking
	   during testing.

       o   --stress-datadir=path

	   The directory of data files to be used during testing. The default
	   location is the data directory under the location given by the
	   --stress-suite-basedir option.

       o   --stress-init-file[=path]

	   file_name is the location of the file that contains the list of
	   tests to be run once to initialize the database for the testing. If
	   missing, the default file is stress_init.txt in the test suite
	   directory.

       o   --stress-mode=mode

	   This option indicates the test order in stress-test mode. The mode
	   value is either random to select tests in random order or seq to
	   run tests in each thread in the order specified in the test list
	   file. The default mode is random.

       o   --stress-suite-basedir=path

	   This option is required.  path is the directory that has the t and
	   r subdirectories containing the test case and result files. This
	   directory is also the default location of the stress-test.txt file
	   that contains the list of tests. (A different location can be
	   specified with the --stress-tests-file option.)

       o   --stress-tests-file[=file_name]

	   Use this option to run the stress tests.  file_name is the location
	   of the file that contains the list of tests. If file_name is
	   omitted, the default file is stress-test.txt in the stress suite
	   directory. (See --stress-suite-basedir.)

       o   --suite=suite_name

	   Run the named test suite. The default name is main (the regular
	   test suite located in the mysql-test directory).

       o   --test-count=N

	   The number of tests to execute before exiting.

       o   --test-duration=N

	   The duration of stress testing in seconds.

       o   --threads=N

	   The number of threads. The default is 1.

       o   --verbose

	   Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
