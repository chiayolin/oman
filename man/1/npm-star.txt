NAME
       npm-star - Mark your favorite packages

SYNOPSIS
	 npm star <pkgname> [<pkg>, ...]
	 npm unstar <pkgname> [<pkg>, ...]

DESCRIPTION
       "Starring"  a  package means that you have some interest in it.	It's a
       vaguely positive way to show that you care.

       "Unstarring" is the same thing, but in reverse.

       It's a boolean thing.  Starring repeatedly has no additional effect.
